Be- ginning with distributions made after December 31, 2023, a distribution to an individual for certain emergency per- sonal expenses is not subject to the 10% additional tax on early distributions if certain requirements are met. For more information, see Distributions for emergency per- sonal expenses , later. Transfers and rollovers of assets and the substan- tially equal payment method. Beginning after Decem- ber 31, 2023, certain transfers and rollovers of assets from qualified plans or annuity contracts using the substantially equal periodic payment method are not considered a modification of the distribution method if certain require- ments are met. See T ransfers and rollovers of assets , for more information. Reminders Excise tax relief for certain 2024 required minimum distributions. The IRS will not assert an excise tax in 2024 for missed RMDs if certain requirements are met. See Notice 2024 -35, available at IRS.gov/irb/ 2024-19_IRB#NOT -2024-35 , for details. Income on corrective distributions of excess contri- butions. The income on the corrective distribution of ex- cess contributions made on or after, December 29, 2022, is no longer subject to the 10% additional tax on early dis- tributions. See Pub. 590-A for more information. Modification of required distribution rules for desig- nated beneficiaries. There are new required minimum distribution rules for certain beneficiaries who are desig- nated beneficiaries when the IRA owner dies in a tax year beginning after December 31, 2019. All distributions must be made by the end of the 10th year after death, except for distributions made to certain eligible designated bene- ficiaries. See 10-year rule , later, for more information. Simplified employee pension (SEP) and SIMPLE plans. SEP and SIMPLE IRAs aren’t covered in this pub- lication. They are covered in Pub. 560, Retirement Plans for Small Business. Deemed IRAs. A qualified employer plan (retirement plan) can maintain a separate account or annuity under the plan (a deemed IRA) to receive voluntary employee contributions. If the separate account or annuity otherwise meets the requirements of an IRA, it will be subject only to IRA rules. An employee's account can be treated as a tra- ditional IRA or a Roth IRA. For this purpose, a “qualified employer plan” includes: •A qualified pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan (section 401(a) plan); •A qualified employee annuity plan (section 403(a) plan); •A tax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403(b) plan); and •A deferred compensation plan (section 457 plan) maintained by a state, a political subdivision of a state, or an agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state.Statement of required minimum distribution (RMD). If an RMD is required from your IRA, the trustee, custo- dian, or issuer that held the IRA at the end of the preced- ing year must either report the amount of the RMD to you, or offer to calculate it for you. The report or offer must in- clude the date by which the amount must be distributed. The report is due January 31 of the year in which the mini- mum distribution is required. It can be provided with the year- end fair market value statement that you normally get each year. No report is required for section 403(b) con- tracts (generally tax -sheltered annuities) or for IRAs of owners who have died. IRA interest. Although interest earned from your IRA is generally not taxed in the year earned, it isn't tax -exempt interest. T ax on your traditional IRA is generally deferred until you take a distribution. Don't report this interest on your return as tax -exempt interest. For more information on tax- exempt interest, see the instructions for your tax re- turn. Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). For purposes of the NIIT , net investment income doesn't include distributions from a qualified retirement plan (for example, 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), or 457(b) plans, and IRAs). However, these distributions are taken into account when determin- ing the modified adjusted gross income threshold. Distri- butions from a nonqualified retirement plan are included in net investment income. See Form 8960, Net Investment Income T ax —Individuals, Estates, and T rusts, and its in- structions for more information. Photographs of missing children. The IRS is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC) . Photographs of missing children se- lected by the Center may appear in this publication on pa- ges that would otherwise be blank. Y ou can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 1 -800-THE- LOST (1 -800-843- 5678) if you recog- nize a child. Introduction This publication discusses distributions from individual re- tirement arrangements (IRAs). An IRA is a personal sav- ings plan that gives you tax advantages for setting aside money for retirement. For information about contributions to an IRA, see Pub. 590-A. What are some tax advantages of an IRA? T wo tax ad- vantages of an IRA are that: •Contributions you make to an IRA may be fully or parti- ally deductible, depending on which type of IRA you have and on your circumstances; and •Generally, amounts in your IRA (including earnings and gains) aren't taxed until distributed. In some ca- ses, amounts aren't taxed at all if distributed according to the rules. 2 Publication 590-B (2024) --- Page 3 --- Page 3 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

In this publication, the original IRA (sometimes called an ordinary or regular IRA) is referred to as a “traditional IRA.” A tradi- tional IRA is any IRA that isn't a Roth IRA or a SIMPLE IRA. What if You Inherit an IRA? If you inherit a traditional IRA, you are called a beneficiary. A beneficiary can be any person or entity the owner choo- ses to receive the benefits of the IRA after the owner dies. Beneficiaries of a traditional IRA must include in their gross income any taxable distributions they receive. IRAs inherited from decedents who died in 2019 or earlier are subject to different rules. See Retirement T opics - Beneficiary , for more informa- tion. Inherited from spouse. If you inherit a traditional IRA from your spouse, you generally have the following three choices. 1.T reat it as your own IRA by designating yourself as the account owner; 2.T reat it as your own by rolling it over into your IRA, or to the extent it is taxable, into a: a.Qualified employer plan, b.Qualified employee annuity plan (section 403(a) plan), c.T ax-sheltered annuity plan (section 403(b) plan), d.Deferred compensation plan of a state or local government (section 457 plan), or 3.T reat yourself as the beneficiary rather than treating the IRA as your own. Treating it as your own. Y ou will be considered to have chosen to treat the IRA as your own if: •Contributions (including rollover contributions) are made to the inherited IRA, or •Y ou don't take the required minimum distribution for a year as a beneficiary of the IRA. Y ou will only be considered to have chosen to treat the IRA as your own if: •Y ou are the sole beneficiary of the IRA, and TIP•Y ou have an unlimited right to withdraw amounts from it. However, if you receive a distribution from your de- ceased spouse's IRA, you can roll that distribution over into your own IRA within the 60 -day time limit, as long as the distribution isn't a required distribution, even if you aren't the sole beneficiary of your deceased spouse's IRA. For more information, see When Must Y ou Withdraw As- sets? (Required Minimum Distributions) , later. Inherited from someone other than spouse. If you in- herit a traditional IRA from anyone other than your de- ceased spouse, you can't treat the inherited IRA as your own. This means that you can't make any contributions to the IRA. It also means you can't roll over any amounts into or out of the inherited IRA. However, you can make a trustee-to- trustee transfer as long as the IRA into which amounts are being moved is set up and maintained in the name of the deceased IRA owner for the benefit of you as beneficiary. Like the original owner, you generally won't owe tax on the assets in the IRA until you receive distributions from it. Y ou must begin receiving distributions from the IRA under the rules for distributions that apply to beneficiaries. IRA with basis. If you inherit a traditional IRA from a per- son who had a basis in the IRA because of nondeductible contributions, that basis remains with the IRA. Unless you are the decedent's spouse and choose to treat the IRA as your own, you can't combine this basis with any basis you have in your own traditional IRA(s) or any basis in tradi- tional IRA(s) you inherited from other decedents. If you take distributions from both an inherited IRA and your IRA, and each has basis, you must complete separate Forms 8606 to determine the taxable and nontaxable portions of those distributions. Federal estate tax deduction. A beneficiary may be able to claim a deduction for estate tax resulting from cer- tain distributions from a traditional IRA. The beneficiary can deduct the estate tax paid on any part of a distribution that is income with respect to a decedent. They can take the deduction for the tax year the income is reported. For information on claiming this deduction, see Estate T ax De- duction under Other T ax Information in Pub. 559. Any taxable part of a distribution that isn't income with respect to a decedent is a payment the beneficiary must include in income. However, the beneficiary can't take any deduction for estate tax. A surviving spouse can roll over the distribution to an- other traditional IRA and avoid including it in income for the year received. More information. For more information about rollovers, required distributions, and inherited IRAs, see: •Rollovers under Can Y ou Move Retirement Plan As- sets? in chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A; •When Must Y ou Withdraw Assets?

MUST be removed before printing. •The discussion of IRA Beneficiaries , later, under When Must Y ou Withdraw Assets? (Required Mini- mum Distributions). When Can You Withdraw or Use Assets? Y ou can withdraw or use your traditional IRA assets at any time. However, a 10% additional tax generally applies if you withdraw or use IRA assets before you reach age 591/2. This is explained under Age 59 1/2 Rule under Early Distributions , later. If you were affected by a qualified disaster, see chap- ter 3 . Y ou can generally make a tax -free withdrawal of contri- butions if you do it before the due date for filing your tax return for the year in which you made them. This means that even if you are under age 591/2, the 10% additional tax may not apply unless you meet one of the exceptions. These distributions are explained in Pub. 590-A. When Must You Withdraw Assets? (Required Minimum Distributions) Y ou can't keep funds in a traditional IRA (including SEP and SIMPLE IRAs) indefinitely. Eventually, they must be distributed. If there are no distributions, or if the distribu- tions aren't large enough, you may have to pay an excise tax on the amount not distributed as required. See Excess Accumulations (Insufficient Distributions) , later, under What Acts Result in Penalties or Additional T axes . The re- quirements for distributing IRA funds differ, depending on whether you are the IRA owner or the beneficiary of a de- cedent's IRA. Required minimum distribution (RMD). The amount that must be distributed each year is referred to as the re- quired minimum distribution. Note. A qualified charitable distribution will count to- wards your required minimum distribution. See Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) under Are Distributions T axable, later. Distributions not eligible for rollover. Amounts that must be distributed (required minimum distributions) dur- ing a particular year aren't normally eligible for rollover treatment. IRA Owners Required beginning date. If you are the owner of a tra- ditional IRA, you must generally start receiving distribu- tions from your IRA by April 1 of the year following the year in which you reach your applicable required beginning date. Your required beginning date. See the following to de- termine your applicable required beginning date. Age 73 for tax years 2023 and later. If you were born after December 31, 1950, but before January 1, 1959, you must begin receiving required minimum distri- butions by April 1 of the year following the year you reach the age 73. Age 72 for tax years 2020, 2021, or 2022. If you were born after June 30, 1949, you must begin receiving required minimum distributions by April 1 of the year fol- lowing the year you reach age 72. Age 70 ½ for tax years 2019 or earlier. If you were born before July 1, 1949, you were required to begin re- ceiving required minimum distributions by April 1 of the year following the year you reach age 70 ½. Distributions by the required beginning date. Y ou must receive at least a minimum amount for each year starting with the year before the year that contains your re- quired beginning date. If an IRA owner dies after reaching age 73, but before their required beginning date, no minimum distribution is required for that year because death occurred before the required beginning date. Even if you begin receiving distributions before you reach age 73, you must begin calculating and receiving RMDs by your required beginning date. More than minimum received. If, in any year, you re- ceive more than the required minimum distribution for that year, you won't receive credit for the additional amount when determining the required minimum distributions for future years. This means that if you receive more than your required minimum distribution in 1 year, you can't treat the excess (the amount that is more than the required minimum distribution) as part of your required minimum distribution for any later year. However, any amount dis- tributed in the year you become age 73 will be credited to- ward the amount that must be distributed by April 1 of the following year. Distributions after the required beginning date. The required minimum distribution for any year after the year you reach age 73 must be made by December 31 of that later year. Distributions from individual retirement accounts. If you are the owner of a traditional IRA that is an individual retirement account, you or your trustee must figure the re- quired minimum distribution for each year. See Figuring the Owner's Required Minimum Distribution , later. Distributions from individual retirement annuities. If your traditional IRA is an individual retirement annuity, special rules apply to figuring the required minimum distri- bution. For more information on rules for annuities, see Regulations section 1. 401(a)(9)- 6. These regulations can CAUTION! 6 Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs Publication 590-B (2024) --- Page 7 --- Page 7 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. be read in many libraries, and IRS offices, and online at IRS.gov . Change in marital status. For purposes of figuring your required minimum distribution, your marital status is deter- mined as of January 1 of each year. If your spouse is a beneficiary of your IRA on January 1, they will remain a beneficiary for the entire year even if you get divorced or your spouse dies during the year. For purposes of deter- mining your distribution period, a change in beneficiary is effective in the year following the year of death or divorce. Change of beneficiary. If your spouse is the sole ben- eficiary of your IRA, and they die before you, your spouse won't fail to be your sole beneficiary for the year they died solely because someone other than your spouse is named a beneficiary for the rest of that year. However, if you get divorced during the year and change the beneficiary des- ignation on the IRA during that same year, your former spouse won't be treated as the sole beneficiary for that year. Figuring the Owner's Required Minimum Distribution Figure your required minimum distribution for each year by dividing the IRA account balance (defined next) as of the close of business on December 31 of the preceding year by the applicable distribution period or life expectancy. T a- bles showing distribution periods and life expectancies are found in Appendix B and are discussed later. IRA account balance. The IRA account balance is the amount in the IRA at the end of the year preceding the year for which the required minimum distribution is being figured. Contributions. Contributions increase the account balance in the year they are made. If a contribution for last year isn't made until after December 31 of last year, it in- creases the account balance for this year, but not for last year. Disregard contributions made after December 31 of last year in determining your required minimum distribu- tion for this year. Outstanding rollovers. The IRA account balance is adjusted by outstanding rollovers that aren't in any ac- count at the end of the preceding year. For a rollover from a qualified plan or another IRA that wasn't in any account at the end of the preceding year, in- crease the account balance of the receiving IRA by the rollover amount valued as of the date of receipt. No recharacterizations of conversions made in 2018 or later. A conversion of a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, and a rollover from any other eligible retirement plan to a Roth IRA, made in tax years beginning after Decem- ber 31, 2017, cannot be recharacterized as having been made to a traditional IRA. Distributions. Distributions reduce the account bal- ance in the year they are made. A distribution for last year made after December 31 of last year reduces the account balance for this year, but not for last year. Disregard distributions made after December 31 of last year in deter- mining your required minimum distribution for this year. Distribution period. This is the number by which you di- vide your account balance as of December 31 of last year in order to calculate your required minimum distribution. The period to use for 2025 is listed next to your age as of your birthday in 2025 in T able III in Appendix B. Distributions during your lifetime. Required minimum distributions during your lifetime are based on a distribu- tion period that is generally determined using T able III (Uniform Lifetime) in Appendix B. However, if the sole ben- eficiary of your IRA is your spouse who is more than 10 years younger than you, see Sole beneficiary spouse who is more than 10 years younger below. T o figure the required minimum distribution for 2025, di- vide your account balance at the end of 2024 by the distri- bution period from the table. This is the distribution period listed next to your age (as of your birthday in 2025) in T a- ble III in Appendix B, unless the sole beneficiary of your IRA is your spouse who is more than 10 years younger than you. Example. Y ou own a traditional IRA. Y our account bal- ance at the end of 2024 was $100,000. Y ou are married and your spouse, who is the sole beneficiary of your IRA, is 6 years younger than you. Y ou turn 75 years old in 2025. Y ou use T able III . Y our distribution period is 24.6. Y our re- quired minimum distribution for 2025 would be $4,065 ($100,000 ÷ 24.6). Life expectancy. If you must use T able I , your life expect- ancy for 2025 is listed in the table next to your age as of your birthday in 2025. If you use T able II , your life expect- ancy for 2025 is listed where the row or column containing your age as of your birthday in 2025 intersects with the row or column containing your spouse's age as of their birthday in 2025. Both T able I and T able II are in Appendix B. Sole beneficiary spouse who is more than 10 years younger. If the sole beneficiary of your IRA is your spouse and your spouse is more than 10 years younger than you, use the life expectancy from T able II (Joint Life and Last Survivor Expectancy) in Appendix B. The life expectancy to use is the joint life and last survi- vor expectancy listed where the row or column containing your age as of your birthday in 2025 intersects with the row or column containing your spouse's age as of their birthday in 2025. Y ou figure your required minimum distribution for 2025 by dividing your account balance at the end of 2024 by the life expectancy from T able II (Joint Life and Last Survivor Expectancy) in Appendix B. Example. Y ou own a traditional IRA. Y our account bal- ance at the end of 2024 was $100,000. Y ou are married and your spouse, who is the sole beneficiary of your IRA, is 11 years younger than you. Y ou turn 75 in 2025 and your spouse turns 64. Y ou use T able II . Y our joint life and last survivor expectancy is 25.3. Y our required minimum distribution for 2025 would be $3,953 ($100,000 ÷ 25.3).

If you purchase an annu- ity contract with a portion of your IRA account balance, then special rules may apply in determining your RMD from the remaining account balance. Specifically, you may elect to satisfy the RMD requirement for the year by com- bining the value of that contract with the remaining ac- count balance and reducing the RMD by the annuity pay- ment Example. Y ou own a traditional IRA. In 2024, you pur- chase an annuity contract with a portion of your account balance. As of December 31, 2024, your remaining ac- count balance is $100,000, and the value of the annuity contract is $200,000. Y our annuity payments in 2024 total $8,000. T o use the rule described in the paragraph above, your RMD required from the remaining account balance for 2025 would be the excess of the RMD based on the total of the remaining account balance and the value of the an- nuity contract ($300,000), over the $8,000 annuity pay- ments. Distributions in the year of the owner's death. The re- quired minimum distribution for the year of the owner's death depends on whether the owner died before the re- quired beginning date , defined earlier. If the owner died before the required beginning date, there is no required minimum distribution in the year of the owner's death. For years after the year of the owner's death, see Owner Died Before Required Beginning Date , later, under IRA Beneficiaries. If the owner died on or after the required beginning date, the IRA beneficiaries are responsible for figuring and distributing the owner's required minimum distribution in the year of death. The owner's required minimum distribu- tion for the year of death is generally based on T able III (Uniform Lifetime) in Appendix B. However, if the sole ben- eficiary of the IRA is the owner's spouse who is more than 10 years younger than the owner, use the life expectancy from T able II (Joint Life and Last Survivor Expectancy) . Note. Y ou figure the required minimum distribution for the year in which an IRA owner dies as if the owner lived for the entire year. IRA Beneficiaries The rules for determining required minimum distributions for beneficiaries depend on whether: •The beneficiary is the surviving spouse. •The beneficiary is an eligible designated beneficiary (defined later) other than the surviving spouse. •The beneficiary is an individual (other than an eligible designated beneficiary). •The beneficiary isn't an individual (for example, the beneficiary is the owner's estate). (But see T rust as beneficiary , later, for a discussion about treating trust beneficiaries as designated beneficiaries.)•The IRA owner died before the required beginning date, or died on or after the required beginning date. The following paragraphs explain the rules for required minimum distributions and beneficiaries. If you are a beneficiary of an inherited traditional IRA and you do not take the required minimum distribution for the year, discussed in this chapter under When Must Y ou Withdraw Assets? (Required Mini- mum Distributions) , you may have to pay an excise tax for that year on the amount not distributed as required. For details, see Excess Accumulations (Insufficient Distribu- tions) under What Acts Result in Penalties or Additional T axes, later in this chapter. Surviving spouse. If you are the surviving spouse who is the sole beneficiary of your deceased spouse's IRA, you may elect to be treated as the owner and not as the bene- ficiary. If you elect to be treated as the owner, you deter- mine the required minimum distribution (if any) as if you were the owner beginning with the year you elect or are deemed to be the owner. For details, see Inherited from spouse under What if Y ou Inherit an IRA , earlier in this chapter. Note. If you become the owner in the year your de- ceased spouse died, don't determine the required mini- mum distribution for that year using your life expectancy; rather, you must take the deceased owner's required mini- mum distribution for that year (to the extent it wasn't al- ready distributed to the owner before their death). Y ou can never make a rollover contribution of a re- quired minimum distribution. Any rollover contri- bution of a required minimum distribution is sub- ject to the 6% tax on excess contributions. See chapter 1 of Pub. 590 -A for more information on the tax on excess contributions. For any year after the owner’s death, where a sur- viving spouse is the sole designated beneficiary of the account and they fail to take a required min- imum distribution (if one is required) by December 31 un- der the rules discussed below for beneficiaries, they will be deemed the owner of the IRA. For details, see Inherited from spouse under What if Y ou Inherit an IRA , earlier in this chapter. Date the designated beneficiary is determined. Gen- erally, the designated beneficiary is determined on Sep- tember 30 of the calendar year following the calendar year of the IRA owner's death. In order to be a designated ben- eficiary, an individual must be a beneficiary as of the date of death. Any person who was a beneficiary on the date of the owner's death, but isn't a beneficiary on September 30 of the calendar year following the calendar year of the owner's death (because, for example, they disclaimed en- titlement or received their entire benefit), won't be taken into account in determining the designated beneficiary. Note. If an individual who is a beneficiary as of the owner's date of death dies before September 30 of the CAUTION! CAUTION!

For the exception to this rule, see Death of surviving spouse prior to date distributions begin , later. More than one beneficiary. If an IRA has more than one beneficiary or a trust is named as beneficiary, see Miscel- laneous Rules for Required Minimum Distributions , later. Eligible designated beneficiaries. An IRA beneficiary is an eligible designated beneficiary if the beneficiary is the owner's surviving spouse, the owner's minor child, a disabled individual, a chronically ill individual, or any other individual who is not more than 10 years younger than the IRA owner. Death of a beneficiary. In general, the beneficiaries of a deceased beneficiary must continue to take the required minimum distributions after the deceased beneficiary's death. However, the beneficiaries of a deceased benefi- ciary don't calculate required minimum distributions using their own life expectancies. Instead, the deceased benefi- ciary's remaining interest must be distributed within 10 years after the beneficiary's death, or in some cases within 10 years after the owner's death. See 10-year rule , later. Owner Died on or After Required Beginning Date If the owner died on or after their required beginning date (defined earlier) and you are a designated beneficiary, base your required minimum distributions for years after the year of the owner’s death on the longer of: •Y our single life expectancy shown in T able I in Appen- dix B; or •The owner's life expectancy. If there is no designated beneficiary, use the owner's life expectancy. See T able I (Single Life Expectancy) , for more information. Surviving spouse is sole designated beneficiary. If you are the owner's surviving spouse, then the applicable denominator continues to be determined each subse- quent year, using either T able I or T able III. Designated beneficiary who is not an eligible desig- nated beneficiary. Distributions to a designated benefi- ciary who is not an eligible designated beneficiary must be completed within 10 years of the death of the owner. See 10-year rule , later. Owner Died Before Required Beginning Date If the owner died before their required beginning date (de- fined earlier) and you are an eligible designated benefi- ciary (such as and including a surviving spouse who is a sole survivor), you must generally base your required min- imum distributions for the year after the year of the own- er's death using your single life expectancy shown in T able I. However, if you are the surviving spouse, you may use T able III if you are the sole designated beneficiary. For each subsequent calendar year, if you are not the surviving spouse the applicable denominator is reduced by one for each calendar year that has elapsed after the calendar year following the employee's death. If you are the owner's surviving spouse, then the applicable denomi- nator continues to be determined each subsequent year, using either T able I or T able III. However, there are situations where a beneficiary may be required to take the entire account balance by the end of the 10th year following the year of the owner's death. See 10-year rule , later. If the owner’s beneficiary isn’t an individual (for exam- ple, if the beneficiary is the owner’s estate), the 5-year rule, discussed later, applies. Special rules for surviving spouse. If the owner died before their required beginning date and the surviving spouse is the sole designated beneficiary, that spouse can elect to be treated as the IRA owner. Year of first required distribution. If the owner died before the year in which they reached age 73 (or age 701/2 if the owner was born before July 1, 1949), and the surviv- ing spouse elects to be treated as the IRA owner, distribu- tions to the spouse don't need to begin until the year in which the owner would have reached age 73 (or age 70½, if applicable). See Y our required beginning date for more information. Death of surviving spouse prior to date distribu- tions begin. If the surviving spouse dies before Decem- ber 31 of the year they must begin receiving required mini- mum distributions, the surviving spouse will be treated as if they were the owner of the IRA. This rule doesn't apply to the surviving spouse of a sur- viving spouse. Example 1. Y our spouse died in 2021, at age 65. Y ou are the sole designated beneficiary of your spouse’s tradi- tional IRA. Y ou don't need to take any required minimum distribution until December 31 of 2029, the year your spouse would have reached age 73. If you die prior to that date, you will be treated as the owner of the IRA for purpo- ses of determining the required distributions to your bene- ficiaries. For example, if you die in 2024, your beneficiaries won't have any required minimum distribution for 2024 (because you, treated as the owner, died prior to your re- quired beginning date). They must start taking distribu- tions under the general rules for an owner who died prior to the required beginning date. Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 , except your sole beneficiary upon your death in 2024 is your surviving spouse. Y our surviving spouse can't wait until the year you would have turned age 73 to take Publication 590-B (2024) Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs 9 --- Page 10 --- Page 10 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. distributions using their life expectancy. Also, if your sur- viving spouse dies prior to the date they are required to take a distribution, they aren’t treated as the owner of the account. Just like any other individual beneficiary of an owner who dies before the required beginning date, your surviving spouse must start taking distributions in 2025 based on their life expectancy (or elect to fully distribute the account under the 10-year rule by the end of 2034). 5-year rule. The 5 -year rule requires the IRA benefi- ciaries who are not taking life expectancy payments to withdraw the entire balance of the IRA by December 31 of the year containing the fifth anniversary of the owner’s death. For example, if the owner died in 2024, the benefi- ciary would have to fully distribute the IRA by December 31, 2029. The 5 -year rule applies to beneficiaries who are not designated beneficiaries if the owner died before their re- quired beginning date (such as an estate or trust (but see T rust as beneficiary , later)). Before 2020, it also applied to designated beneficiaries who are not taking life expect- ancy payments. If the owner died after 2019 and the bene- ficiary is an individual who is a designated beneficiary, see the 10-year rule , for more information. 10-year rule. The 10-year rule requires the IRA benefi- ciaries who are not taking life expectancy payments to withdraw the entire balance of the IRA by December 31 of the year containing the 10th anniversary of the owner’s death. For example, if the owner died in 2024, the benefi- ciary would have to fully distribute the IRA by December 31, 2034. The 10- year rule applies if (1) the beneficiary is an eligi- ble designated beneficiary who elects the 10 -year rule, if the owner died before reaching their required beginning date; or (2) the beneficiary is a designated beneficiary who is not an eligible designated beneficiary, regardless of whether the owner died before reaching their required beginning date. For a beneficiary receiving life expectancy payments who is either an eligible designated beneficiary or a minor child, the 10 -year rule also applies to the remaining amounts in the IRA upon the death of the eligible designa- ted beneficiary or upon the minor child beneficiary reach- ing the age of majority, but in either of those cases, the 10-year period ends on December 31 of the year contain- ing the 10th anniversary of the eligible designated benefi- ciary's death or the child's attainment of majority. Payment under the 10 -year rule. If the IRA owner dies before the required beginning date and the 10 -year rule applies, no distribution is required for any year before the 10th year. Individual designated beneficiaries. The terms of most IRAs require individual designated beneficiaries, who are eligible designated beneficiaries, to take required minimum distributions using the life expectancy rules (ex- plained later) unless such beneficiaries elect to take distri- butions using the 10-year rule . The deadline for making this election is the earlier of December 31 of the year the beneficiary must take the first required distribution, using their life expectancy or De- cember 31 of the 10th anniversary for the 10-year rule. If the individual designated beneficiary is not an eligible designated beneficiary, the beneficiary is required to fully distribute the IRA by the 10th anniversary of the owner's death under the 10-year rule. Review the IRA plan documents or consult with the IRA custodian or trustee for specifics on the 5 - or 10 -year rule provisions, where applicable, of any particular IRA. If the 5 -year rule applies, the amount remaining in the IRA, if any, after December 31 of the year con- taining the fifth anniversary of the owner's death is subject to the excise tax detailed in Excess Accumulations (Insufficient Distributions) , later. If the 10 -year rule applies, the amount remaining in the IRA, if any, after December 31 of the year containing the 10th anniversary of the owner's death is subject to the excise tax detailed in Excess Accu- mulations (Insufficient Distributions) , later. Figuring the Beneficiary's RMD How you figure the required minimum distribution de- pends on whether the beneficiary is an individual or some other entity, such as a trust or estate. Beneficiary is an individual. If the beneficiary is an indi- vidual, figure the required minimum distribution for 2025 as follows. Life expectancy payments. Divide the account bal- ance at the end of 2024 by the appropriate life expectancy from T able I (Single Life Expectancy) in Appendix B. De- termine the appropriate life expectancy as follows. Spouse as sole designated beneficiary. Several special rules affect figuring your RMD if you, as a spouse, are the sole designated beneficiary of the IRA owner. If you are a surviving spouse of the IRA owner and the sole designated beneficiary on that IRA, you can elect to treat the inherited IRA as your own. See Special rules for surviving spouse , earlier, for more information. If you continue to be treated as a beneficiary of the owner, you may use the life expectancy you find in T able III (Uniform Lifetime T able) to determine your RMD. Whether the IRA owner has begun receiving RMDs also affects how you figure your RMDs. See Owner Died on or After Required Beginning Date and Owner Died Be- fore Required Beginning Date , earlier. See Which T able Do Y ou Use T o Determine Y our Re- quired Minimum Distribution for information on which table to use for figuring your RMD. Y ou can't make a rollover contribution of your re- quired minimum distributions. Such contribution is subject to the 6% tax on excess contributions. See chapter 1 of Pub. 590 -A for more information on the tax on excess contributions. TIP CAUTION! CAUTION!

As with the spousal beneficiary discussed earlier, whether the IRA owner has begun receiving RMDs also affect how you figure your RMDs. See Owner Died on or After Required Beginning Date and Owner Died Before Required Beginning Date , earlier. See Which T able Do Y ou Use T o Determine Y our Re- quired Minimum Distribution , later, for information on which table to use for figuring your RMD.

See the 5-year rule if the owner died before the owner's required beginning date and the beneficiary is not an individual (such as an estate or trust (but see T rust as beneficiary , later). Which Table Do You Use To Determine Your Required Minimum Distribution? There are three different life expectancy tables. The tables are found in Appendix B of this publication. Y ou use only one of them to determine your required minimum distribu- tion for each traditional IRA. Determine which one to use as follows. Reminder. In using the tables for lifetime distributions, marital status is determined as of January 1 each year. Di- vorce or death after January 1 is generally disregarded until the next year. The change in beneficiary will take effect in the year af- ter the distribution calendar year following the year that in- cludes the spouse's death or divorce. Table I (Single Life Expectancy). Use T able I for years after the year of the owner’s death if you are the owner’s eligible designated beneficiary. If you are the owner's sur- viving spouse and sole designated beneficiary, see T able III (Uniform Lifetime T able) later, for more information. If you are the owner’s eligible designated beneficiary, find your life expectancy in the year following the owner’s death. Use your age as of your birthday in the year distri- butions must begin. This is usually the calendar year im- mediately following the calendar year of the owner's death. After the first distribution year, reduce your life ex- pectancy by one for each subsequent year. If there is no designated beneficiary, use the life expect- ancy based on the owner’s age as of the owner’s birthday in the calendar year of their death. The life expectancy in the years after the owner’s death is reduced by one for each calendar year that has elapsed after the calendar year of the owner’s death. Example. Y ou are an eligible designated beneficiary figuring your first required minimum distribution. Distribu- tions must begin in 2025. Y ou become age 57 in 2025. Y ou use T able I. Y our distribution period for 2025 is 29.8. Owner's life expectancy. Y ou use the owner’s life ex- pectancy to calculate required minimum distributions when the owner dies on or after the required beginning date and there is no designated beneficiary as of Septem- ber 30 of the year following the year of the owner’s death. In this case, use the owner’s life expectancy for their age as of the owner’s birthday in the year of death and re- duce it by 1 for each subsequent year. If the beneficiary is older than the deceased IRA owner, use the owner’s life expectancy in the year of death (reduced by 1 for each subsequent year). Table II (Joint and Last Survivor Life Expectancy). Use T able II if you are the IRA owner and your spouse is both your sole designated beneficiary and more than 10 years younger than you. For your first distribution by the required beginning date, use your age and the age of your designated benefi- ciary as of your birthdays in the year you become age 73. Y our combined life expectancy is at the intersection of your ages. If you are figuring your required minimum distribution for 2025, use your ages as of your birthdays in 2025. For each subsequent year, use your and your spouse's ages as of your birthdays in the subsequent year. Note. Use this table in the year of the owner's death if the owner died after the required beginning date and this is the table that would have been used had they not died. Table III (Uniform Lifetime). Use T able III if you are the IRA owner and your spouse isn’t the sole designated ben- eficiary or if your spouse is the sole designated benefi- ciary of your IRA and not more than 10 years younger than you. Use your age as of your birthday in the year you be- come age 73 to meet your first distribution by your re- quired beginning date. Y ou may also use T able III if you are the owner's surviv- ing spouse and sole designated beneficiary. If you are figuring your required minimum distribution for 2025, use your age as of your birthday in 2025. For each subsequent year, use your age as of your birthday in the subsequent year. Note. Use this table in the year of the owner's death if the owner died after the required beginning date and this is the table that would have been used had they not died. No table. Don't use any of the tables if the owner died before their required beginning date and either the 5-year rule or the 10-year rule (discussed earlier) applies. Miscellaneous Rules for Required Minimum Distributions Revised life expectancy tables for 2022. New life ex- pectancy tables apply to distribution calendar years begin- ning on or after January 1, 2022. Redetermination of initial life expectancies using new tables. If an IRA owner died before January 1, 2022, the distribution period that applies for a calendar year fol- lowing the calendar year of the owner’s death is equal to a Publication 590-B (2024) Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs 11 --- Page 12 --- Page 12 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. single life expectancy calculated as of the calendar year of the owner’s death, reduced by 1 for each subsequent year, and is reset using the new table. In order to do this, find your life expectancy based on your age in the year following the owner’s death on T able I and reduce that number by 1 for each year since the year of the owner’s death. The requirement to reset the initial life expectancy also applies to an owner’s surviving spouse who dies before January 1, 2022. Example. Y our father died in 2020 at the age of 80 and you were the designated beneficiary. Y ou started taking required minimum distributions from the inherited IRA in 2021 when you were age 55, using a life expectancy of 29.6 and reducing that number by 1 each year so that in 2025 (4 years later) the required minimum distribution would be determined by dividing the account balance by 25.6 (29.6 – 4). However, under the new life expectancy tables, the life expectancy for a 55 -year- old is 31.6; there- fore, you calculate your required minimum distribution for 2025 by dividing the account balance by 27.6 (31.6 – 4). Installments allowed. The yearly required minimum dis- tribution can be taken in a series of installments (monthly, quarterly, etc.) as long as the total distributions for the year are at least as much as the minimum required amount. More than one IRA. If you are the owner of more than one traditional IRA, you must determine a separate re- quired minimum distribution for each IRA. However, you can total these minimum amounts and take the total from any one or more of the IRAs. The same rule applies if you are a designated beneficiary of more than one IRA that was owned by a single decedent. More than minimum received. If, in any year, you re- ceive more than the required minimum amount for that year, you won't receive credit for the additional amount when determining the minimum required amounts for fu- ture years. This doesn't mean that you don't reduce your IRA account balance. It means that if you receive more than your required minimum distribution in 1 year, you can't treat the excess (the amount that is more than the re- quired minimum distribution) as part of your required mini- mum distribution for any later year. However, any amount distributed in your age 73 year will be credited toward the amount that must be distributed by April 1 of the following year. Example. Justin became 73 on December 15, 2024. Justin's IRA account balance on December 31, 2023, was $38,400. He figured his required minimum distribution of $1,450 for 2024 ($38,400 ÷ 26.5). By December 31, 2024, he had actually received distributions totaling $3,600, $2,150 more than was required. Justin can’t use that $2,150 to reduce the amount he is required to withdraw for 2025. Justin's reduced IRA account balance on Decem- ber 31, 2024, was $34,800. Justin figured his required minimum distribution of $1,313 for 2025 ($34,800 ÷ 26. 5 (the distribution period for age 73 per T able III)). During 2025, he must receive distributions of at least that amount.Multiple individual beneficiaries. If, as of September 30 of the year following the year in which the owner dies, there is more than one beneficiary, the beneficiary with the shortest life expectancy will be the designated beneficiary if both of the following apply. •All of the beneficiaries are individuals. •The account or benefit hasn't been divided into sepa- rate accounts or shares for each beneficiary. Separate accounts. A single IRA can be split into separate accounts or shares for each beneficiary. These separate accounts or shares can be established at any time, either before or after the owner's required beginning date. Generally, these separate accounts or shares are combined for purposes of determining the required mini- mum distribution. However, these separate accounts or shares won't be combined for required minimum distribu- tion purposes after the death of the IRA owner if the sepa- rate accounts or shares are established by the end of the year following the year of the IRA owner's death. The separate account rules can't be used by beneficia- ries of a trust unless the trust is an applicable multi -benefi- ciary trust. Trust as beneficiary. A trust can't be a designated bene- ficiary even if it is a named beneficiary. However, the ben- eficiaries of a trust will be treated as having been designa- ted beneficiaries for purposes of determining required minimum distributions after the owner’s death (or, after the death of the owner’s surviving spouse described in Death of surviving spouse prior to date distributions begin , ear- lier) if all of the following are true. 1.The trust is a valid trust under state law, or would be but for the fact that there is no corpus. 2.The trust is irrevocable or became, by its terms, irrev- ocable upon the owner's death. 3.The beneficiaries of the trust who are beneficiaries with respect to the trust's interest in the owner's bene- fit are identifiable from the trust instrument. 4.The trustee of the trust provides the IRA custodian or trustee with the documentation required by that custo- dian or trustee. The trustee of the trust should contact the IRA custodian or trustee for details on the docu- mentation required for a specific plan. Trust beneficiary is another trust. If the beneficiary of the trust (which is the beneficiary of the IRA) is another trust and both trusts meet the above requirements, the beneficiaries of the other trust will be treated as having been designated as beneficiaries for purposes of deter- mining the distribution period. Applicable multi -beneficiary trusts. An applicable multi- beneficiary trust is a trust (1) which has more than one beneficiary; (2) all of the beneficiaries of which are treated as designated beneficiaries for purposes of deter- mining the distribution period pursuant to section 401(a) (9); and (3) at least one of the beneficiaries of which is an eligible designated beneficiary who is either disabled or 12 Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs Publication 590-B (2024) --- Page 13 --- Page 13 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. chronically ill. There are two types of applicable multi -ben- eficiary trusts: •a trust that is to be divided immediately upon the death of the employee into separate trusts for each beneficiary, in which case the separate account rules apply to each portion of the trust; and •a trust that provides that no beneficiary (other than an eligible designated beneficiary who is disabled or chronically ill) has any right to the employee’s interest in the plan until the death of all of those disabled or chronically ill eligible designated beneficiaries with re- spect to the trust, in which case the separate account rules do not apply, but the rule permitting payments over the life expectancy of a beneficiary applies to the distribution of the employee’s interest regardless of whether there are other beneficiaries who are not eligi- ble designated beneficiaries. Y ou may want to contact a tax advisor to comply with this complicated area of the tax law. Annuity distributions from an insurance company. Special rules apply if you receive distributions from your traditional IRA as an annuity purchased from an insurance company. See Regulations sections 1. 401(a)(9)- 6 and 54.4974- 2. These regulations can be found in many libra- ries, and IRS offices, and online at IRS.gov . Are Distributions Taxable? In general, distributions from a traditional IRA are taxable in the year you receive them. Failed financial institutions. Distributions from a tradi- tional IRA are taxable in the year you receive them even if they are made without your consent by a state agency as receiver of an insolvent savings institution. This means you must include such distributions in your gross income unless you roll them over. Exceptions. Exceptions to distributions from traditional IRAs being taxable in the year you receive them are: •Rollovers (see chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A); •Qualified charitable distributions , discussed later; •T ax-free withdrawals of contributions (see chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A); and •The return of nondeductible contributions, discussed later under Distributions Fully or Partly T axable . Although a conversion of a traditional IRA is con- sidered a rollover for Roth IRA purposes, it isn't an exception to the rule that distributions from a tradi- tional IRA are taxable in the year you receive them. Con- version distributions are includible in your gross income subject to this rule and the special rules for conversions explained in chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A. TIP CAUTION!Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs). A QCD is generally a nontaxable distribution made directly by the trustee of your IRA (other than an ongoing SEP or SIM- PLE IRA) to an organization eligible to receive tax-deducti- ble contributions. Y ou must be at least age 701/2 when the distribution was made. Also, you must have the same type of acknowledgment of your contribution that you would need to claim a deduction for a charitable contribution. See Substantiation Requirements in Pub. 526. The maximum annual exclusion for QCDs is $105,000. Any QCD in excess of the $105,000 exclusion limit is in- cluded in income as any other distribution. If you file a joint return, your spouse can also have a QCD and exclude up to $105,000. The amount of the QCD is limited to the amount of the distribution that would otherwise be inclu- ded in income. If your IRA includes nondeductible contri- butions, the distribution is first considered to be paid out of otherwise taxable income. Y ou can't claim a charitable contribution deduc- tion for any QCD not included in your income. One- time election for QCD to split -interest entity. Y ou can elect to make a one -time distribution of up to $53,000 from an individual retirement account to charities through a split -interest entity. A split -interest entity (SIE) would be a charitable remainder annuity trust, a charitable remain- der unitrust, or a charitable gift annuity but only if funded by qualified charitable distributions. In the case of the charitable gift annuity, the annuity must begin making fixed payments of 5% or greater not later than 1 year from the date of funding. For more infor- mation, see Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) . A QCD will count towards your required minimum distribution , discussed earlier. Example. On December 23, 2024, Amy, age 75, direc- ted the trustee of her IRA to make a distribution of $25,000 directly to a qualified section 501(c)(3) organization (a charitable organization eligible to receive tax -deductible contributions). The total value of Amy's IRA is $30,000 and consists of $20,000 of deductible contributions and earnings and $10,000 of nondeductible contributions (ba- sis). Because Amy is at least age 701/2 and the distribu- tion is made directly by the trustee to a qualified organiza- tion, the part of the distribution that would otherwise be includible in Amy's income ($20,000) is a QCD. In this case, Amy has made a QCD of $20,000 (her de- ductible contributions and earnings). Because Amy made a distribution of nondeductible contributions from her IRA, she must file Form 8606 with her return. Amy reports the total distribution ($25,000) on line 4a of Form 1040 -SR. She completes Form 8606 to determine the amount to en- ter on line 4b of Form 1040 -SR and the remaining basis in her IRA. Amy enters -0- on line 4b. This is Amy's only IRA and she took no other distributions in 2024. She also en- ters “QCD” next to line 4b to indicate a qualified charitable distribution. After the distribution, her basis in her IRA is $5,000. If Amy itemizes deductions and files Schedule A (Form CAUTION!

She can't take the charita- ble contribution deduction for the $20,000 portion of the distribution that wasn't included in her income. Reporting your one -time election on Form 1040, 1040- SR, or 1040 -NR. If you make the one -time election to make a QCD to a split -interest entity (SIE), you must at- tach a statement to your tax return. If you file your return on paper, then you will enter “SIE” on line 4b of your re- turn. If you file electronically, then you will enter “QCD” on line 4b of your return and name your attachment “SIE.” The attachment should include all of the following infor- mation. 1.That you have not made the election in a prior tax year. 2.That the QCDs are otherwise deductible under sec- tion 408(d)(8)(f)(iii). 3.That no person holds an income interest in an SIE other than the individual for whose benefit the account is maintained, their spouse, or both. 4.That the income interest in the SIE is nonassignable. 5.The total amount of QCD(s) you made to an SIE that relate to your one-time election. Offset of QCDs by amounts contributed after age 701/2. Beginning in tax years after December 31, 2019, the amount of QCDs that you can exclude from income is reduced by the excess of the aggregate amount of IRA contributions you deducted for the taxable year and any prior year that you were age 701/2 or older over the amount of such IRA contributions that were used to reduce the ex- cludable amount of QCDs in all earlier years. See the Qualified Charitable Deduction Adjustment Worksheet in Appendix D. Example. Jim became age 701/2 in 2022 and deduc- ted $5,000 for contributions he made in 2023 and 2024 but makes no contribution for 2025. Jim makes no quali- fied charitable distributions for 2023 and makes qualified charitable distributions of $6,000 for 2024 and $6,500 for 2025.He determines he has no excludable qualified charita- ble distribution for 2024 as figured on his 2024 QCD Worksheet . His 2024 qualified charitable distribution is re- duced by the aggregate amount of $10,000 of the contri- butions he deducted in 2023 and 2024, which reduces his excludable qualified charitable distribution to a negative amount of $4,000. Jim decides to make a qualified charitable distribution of $6,500 for 2025. Jim completes his 2025 QCD work- sheet by entering the amount of the remainder of the ag- gregate amount of the contributions he deducted in 2023 and 2024 ($4,000) on line 1. This amount is figured on his 2024 QCD worksheet and is entered on line 1 of his 2025 QCD worksheet. Jim figures his excludable qualified chari- table distribution of $2,500 on his 2025 QCD worksheet ($6,500 – $4,000 = $2,500). One- time qualified Health Savings Account (HSA) funding distribution. Y ou may be able to make a quali- fied HSA funding distribution from your traditional IRA or Roth IRA to your HSA. Y ou can't make this distribution from an ongoing SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA. For this pur- pose, a SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA is ongoing if an employer contribution is made for the plan year ending with or within your tax year in which the distribution would be made. The distribution must be less than or equal to your maximum annual HSA contribution. This distribution must be made directly by the trustee of the IRA to the trustee of the HSA. The distribution isn't in- cluded in your income, isn't deductible, and reduces the amount that can be contributed to your HSA. Y ou must make the distribution by the end of the year; the special rule allowing contributions to your HSA for the previous year if made by your tax return filing deadline doesn't ap- ply. The qualified HSA funding distribution is reported on Form 8889 for the year in which the distribution is made. One- time transfer. Generally, only one qualified HSA funding distribution is allowed during your lifetime. If you own two or more IRAs, and want to use amounts in multi- ple IRAs to make a qualified HSA funding distribution, you must first make an IRA -to-IRA transfer of the amounts to be distributed into a single IRA, and then make the one-time qualified HSA funding distribution from that IRA.

The qualified HSA funding distribution is included in gross income in the tax year you first fail to be an eligible individual. This amount is subject to the 10% additional tax (unless the failure is due to disability or death). More information. See Pub. 969 for additional infor- mation about this distribution. Ordinary income. Distributions from traditional IRAs that you include in income are taxed as ordinary income. No special treatment. In figuring your tax, you can't use the 10 -year tax option or capital gain treatment that ap- plies to lump -sum distributions from qualified retirement plans. If you were affected by a qualified disaster, see chapter 3 . Distributions Fully or Partly Taxable Distributions from your traditional IRA may be fully or partly taxable, depending on whether your IRA includes any nondeductible contributions. Fully taxable. If only deductible contributions were made to your traditional IRA (or IRAs, if you have more than one), you have no basis in your IRA. Because you have no basis in your IRA, any distributions are fully taxable when received. See Reporting and Withholding Requirements for T axable Amounts , later. Partly taxable. If you made nondeductible contributions or rolled over any after -tax amounts to any of your tradi- tional IRAs, you have a cost basis (investment in the con- tract) equal to the amount of those contributions. These nondeductible contributions aren't taxed when they are distributed to you. They are a return of your investment in your IRA. Only the part of the distribution that represents nonde- ductible contributions and rolled over after -tax amounts (your cost basis) is tax free. If nondeductible contributions have been made or after -tax amounts have been rolled over to your IRA, distributions consist partly of nondeducti- ble contributions (basis) and partly of deductible TIPcontributions, earnings, and gains (if there are any). Until all of your basis has been distributed, each distribution is partly nontaxable and partly taxable. Form 8606. Y ou must complete Form 8606, and attach it to your return, if you receive a distribution from a tradi- tional IRA and have ever made nondeductible contribu- tions or rolled over after -tax amounts to any of your tradi- tional IRAs. Using the form, you will figure the nontaxable distributions for 2024, and your total IRA basis for 2024 and earlier years. See the illustrated Forms 8606 in this chapter. Note. If you are required to file Form 8606, but you aren't required to file an income tax return, you must still file Form 8606. Complete Form 8606, sign it, and send it to the IRS at the time and place you would otherwise file an income tax return. Figuring the Nontaxable and Taxable Amounts If your traditional IRA includes nondeductible contributions and you received a distribution from it in 2024, you must use Form 8606 to figure how much of your 2024 IRA distri- bution is tax free. Note. When figuring the nontaxable and taxable amounts of distributions made prior to death in the year the IRA account owner dies, the value of all traditional (in- cluding SEP) and SIMPLE IRAs should be figured as of the date of death instead of December 31. Contribution and distribution in the same year. If you received a distribution in 2024 from a traditional IRA and you also made contributions to a traditional IRA for 2024 that may not be fully deductible because of the income limits, you can use Worksheet 1 -1 to figure how much of your 2024 IRA distribution is tax free and how much is tax- able. Then, you can figure the amount of nondeductible contributions to report on Form 8606.

In 2024, she makes a $2,000 contribution that may be partly nondeductible. She also receives a distribution of $5,000 for conversion to a Roth IRA. She completed the conversion before December 31, 2024, and didn’t rechar- acterize any contributions. At the end of 2024, the fair market values of her accounts, including earnings, total $20,000. She didn't receive any tax -free distributions in earlier years. The amount she includes in income for 2024 is figured on Worksheet 1 -1.

Distribution of an annuity contract from your IRA ac- count. Y ou can tell the trustee or custodian of your tradi- tional IRA account to use the amount in the account to buy an annuity contract for you. Y ou aren't taxed when you re- ceive the annuity contract (unless the annuity contract is being converted to an annuity held by a Roth IRA). Y ou are taxed when you start receiving payments under that annuity contract. Tax treatment. If only deductible contributions were made to your traditional IRA since it was opened (this in- cludes all your traditional IRAs, if you have more than one), the annuity payments are fully taxable. If any of your traditional IRAs include both deductible and nondeductible contributions, the annuity payments are taxed as explained earlier under Distributions Fully or Partly T axable . Cashing in retirement bonds. When you cash in retire- ment bonds, you are taxed on the entire amount you re- ceive. If you reach age 701/2 and you have not yet cashed in your retirement bonds, you should include the entire value of the bonds in your income in the year in which you turn 701/2. The value of the bonds is the amount you would have received if you had cashed them in at the end of that year. When you later cash in the bonds, you won't be taxed again. Reporting and Withholding Requirements for Taxable Amounts If you receive a distribution from your traditional IRA, you will receive Form 1099 -R, or a similar statement. IRA dis- tributions are shown in boxes 1 and 2a of Form 1099 -R. A number or letter code in box 7 tells you what type of distri- bution you received from your IRA. Number codes. Some of the number codes are ex- plained below. All of the codes are explained in the in- structions for recipients on Form 1099-R. 1—Early distribution, no known exception (in most ca- ses, under age 59½). 2—Early distribution, exception applies (under age 59½). 3—Disability. 4—Death. 5—Prohibited transaction. 7—Normal distribution. 8—Excess contributions plus earnings/ excess deferrals (and/or earnings) taxable in 2024.If code 1, 5, or 8 appears on your Form 1099 -R, you are probably subject to a penalty or additional tax. If code 1 appears, see Early Distributions , later. If code 5 appears, see Prohibited T ransactions , later. If code 8 appears, see Excess Contributions in chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A . Letter codes. Some of the letter codes are explained below. All of the codes are explained in the instructions for recipients on Form 1099-R. B—Designated Roth account distribution. G—Direct rollover of a distribution to a qualified plan, a section 403(b) plan, a governmental section 457(b) plan, or an IRA. H—Direct rollover of a designated Roth account distri- bution to a Roth IRA. J—Early distribution from a Roth IRA, no known ex- ception (in most cases, under age 59½). N—Recharacterized IRA contribution made for 2024 and recharacterized in 2024. P—Excess contributions plus earnings/ excess deferrals (and/or earnings) taxable in 2023. Q—Qualified distribution from a Roth IRA. R—Recharacterized IRA contribution made for 2023 and recharacterized in 2024. S—Early distribution from a SIMPLE IRA in the first 2 years, no known exception (under age 59½). T—Roth IRA distribution, exception applies. If the distribution shown on Form 1099 -R is from your IRA, SEP IRA, or SIMPLE IRA, the small box in box 7 (la- beled IRA/SEP/SIMPLE ) should be marked with an “X.” If code J, P , or S appears on your Form 1099 -R, you are probably subject to a penalty or additional tax. If code J appears, see Early Distributions , later. If code P appears, see Excess Contributions in chapter 1 of Pub. 590 -A. If code S appears, see Distribu- tions (Withdrawals) in chapter 3 of Pub. 560. Withholding. Federal income tax is withheld from distri- butions from traditional IRAs unless you choose not to have tax withheld. If you are receiving periodic payments (payments made in installments at regular intervals over a period of more than 1 year) use Form W -4P to have tax withheld from your IRA. The amount of tax withheld from an annuity or a similar periodic payment is based on your marital status and any adjustments you claim on your Form W-4P . Complete Form W -4R to have taxes withheld from your nonperiodic payments or eligible rollover distribution from your IRA. Generally, tax will be withheld at a 10% rate on nonperiodic payments. IRA distributions delivered outside the United States. In general, if you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien and your home address is outside the United States or its territories, you can't choose exemption from withholding on distributions from your traditional IRA. CAUTION! CAUTION! Publication 590-B (2024) Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs 21 --- Page 22 --- Page 22 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. T o choose exemption from withholding, you must certify to the payer under penalties of perjury that you aren't a U.S. citizen, a resident alien of the United States, or a tax-avoidance expatriate. Even if this election is made, the payer must withhold tax at the rates prescribed for nonresident aliens. More information. For more information on withhold- ing on pensions and annuities, see Pensions and Annui- ties in chapter 1 of Pub. 505. For more information on withholding on nonresident aliens and foreign entities, see Pensions, Annuities, and Alimony under Withholding on Specific Income in Pub. 515. Reporting taxable distributions on your return. Re- port fully taxable distributions, including early distributions, on Form 1040, 1040 -SR, or 1040 -NR, line 4b (no entry is required on line 4a). If only part of the distribution is taxa- ble, enter the total amount on Form 1040, 1040 -SR, or 1040- NR, line 4a, and enter the taxable part on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 4b. Estate tax. Generally, the value of an annuity or other payment receivable by any beneficiary of a decedent's tra- ditional IRA that represents the part of the purchase price contributed by the decedent (or by their former em- ployer(s)) must be included in the decedent's gross es- tate. For more information, see the instructions for Form 706, Schedule I. What Acts Result in Penalties or Additional Taxes? The tax advantages of using traditional IRAs for retirement savings can be offset by additional taxes and penalties if you don't follow the rules. There are additions to the regu- lar tax for using your IRA funds in prohibited transactions. There are also additional taxes for the following activities. •Investing in collectibles. •Having unrelated business income . •T aking early distributions. •Allowing excess amounts to accumulate (failing to take required distributions). •Making excess contributions. There are penalties for overstating the amount of non- deductible contributions and for failure to file Form 8606, if required. This chapter discusses those acts (relating to distribu- tions) that you should avoid and the additional taxes and other costs, including loss of IRA status, that apply if you don't avoid those acts. Prohibited Transactions Generally, a prohibited transaction is any improper use of your traditional IRA account or annuity by you, your beneficiary, or any disqualified person.Disqualified persons include your fiduciary and mem- bers of your family (spouse, ancestor, lineal descendant, and any spouse of a lineal descendant). The following are some examples of prohibited transac- tions with a traditional IRA. •Borrowing money from it. •Selling property to it. •Using it as security for a loan. •Buying property for personal use (present or future) with IRA funds. If your IRA invested in nonpublicly traded assets or assets that you directly control, the risk of en- gaging in a prohibited transaction in connection with your IRA may be increased. Fiduciary. For these purposes, a fiduciary includes any- one who does any of the following. •Exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control in managing your IRA or exercises any author- ity or control in managing or disposing of its assets. •Provides investment advice to your IRA for a fee, or has any authority or responsibility to do so. •Has any discretionary authority or discretionary re- sponsibility in administering your IRA. Effect on an IRA account. Generally, if you or your ben- eficiary engages in a prohibited transaction in connection with your traditional IRA account at any time during the year, the account stops being an IRA as of the first day of that year. However, if you own more than one IRA, each IRA is treated as a separate account, and loss of IRA status only affects that IRA that participated in that prohibited transac- tion. Effect on you or your beneficiary. If your account stops being an IRA because you or your beneficiary engaged in a prohibited transaction, the account is treated as distrib- uting all its assets to you at their fair market values on the first day of the year. If the total of those values is more than your basis in the IRA, you will have a taxable gain that is includible in your income. For information on figur- ing your gain and reporting it in income, see Are Distribu- tions T axable , earlier. The distribution may be subject to additional taxes or penalties. Borrowing on an annuity contract. If you borrow money against your traditional IRA annuity contract, you must include in your gross income the fair market value of the annuity contract as of the first day of your tax year. Y ou may have to pay the 10% additional tax on early distribu- tions, discussed later. Pledging an account as security. If you use a part of your traditional IRA account as security for a loan, that part is treated as a distribution and is included in your gross income. Y ou may have to pay the 10% additional tax on early distributions, discussed later. CAUTION! 22 Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs Publication 590-B (2024) --- Page 23 --- Page 23 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Trust account set up by an employer or an employee association. Y our account or annuity doesn't lose its IRA treatment if your employer or the employee association with whom you have your traditional IRA engages in a pro- hibited transaction. Owner participation. If you participate in the prohibi- ted transaction with your employer or the association, your account is no longer treated as an IRA. Taxes on prohibited transactions. If someone other than the owner or beneficiary of a traditional IRA engages in a prohibited transaction, that person may be liable for certain taxes. In general, there is a 15% tax on the amount of the prohibited transaction and a 100% additional tax if the transaction isn't corrected. Loss of IRA status. If the traditional IRA ceases to be an IRA because of a prohibited transaction by you or your beneficiary, neither you nor your beneficiary is liable for these excise taxes. However, you or your beneficiary may have to pay other taxes, as discussed under Effect on you or your beneficiary , earlier. Exempt Transactions The Department of Labor has authority to grant adminis- trative exemptions from the prohibited transaction provi- sions of ERISA and the Code for a class of transactions or for individual transactions. In order to grant an administra- tive exemption, the Department must make the following three determinations. 1.The exemption must be administratively feasible. 2.In the interest of the plan and its participants and ben- eficiaries. 3.Protective of the rights of plan participants and benefi- ciaries. For additional information on prohibited transaction ex- emptions, see the Exemptions page on the Department of Labor website. For information on filing and the process- ing of prohibited transaction exemption applications, see Procedures Governing the Filing and Processing of Prohibited T ransaction Exemption Applications . Transactions Not Prohibited The following two types of transactions aren't prohibited transactions if they meet the requirements that follow. •Payments of cash, property, or other consideration by the sponsor of your traditional IRA to you (or members of your family). •Y our receipt of services at reduced or no cost from the bank where your traditional IRA is established or maintained. Payments of cash, property, or other consideration. Even if a sponsor makes payments to you or your family, there is no prohibited transaction if all three of the follow- ing requirements are met.1.The payments are for establishing a traditional IRA or for making additional contributions to it. 2.The IRA is established solely to benefit you, your spouse, and your or your spouse's beneficiaries. 3.During the year, the total fair market value of the pay- ments you receive isn't more than: a.$10 for IRA deposits of less than $5,000, or b.$20 for IRA deposits of $5,000 or more. If the consideration is group -term life insurance, require- ments (1) and (3) don't apply if no more than $5,000 of the face value of the insurance is based on a dollar -for-dollar basis on the assets in your IRA. Services received at reduced or no cost. Even if a sponsor provides services at reduced or no cost, there is no prohibited transaction if all of the following require- ments are met. •The traditional IRA qualifying you to receive the serv- ices is established and maintained for the benefit of you, your spouse, and your or your spouse's benefi- ciaries. •The bank itself can legally offer the services. •The services are provided in the ordinary course of business by the bank (or a bank affiliate) to customers who qualify for but don't maintain an IRA (or a Keogh plan). •The determination, for a traditional IRA, of who quali- fies for these services is based on an IRA (or a Keogh plan) deposit balance equal to the lowest qualifying balance for any other type of account. •The rate of return on a traditional IRA investment that qualifies isn't less than the return on an identical in- vestment that could have been made at the same time at the same branch of the bank by a customer who isn't eligible for (or doesn't receive) these services. Investment in Collectibles If your traditional IRA invests in collectibles, the amount in- vested is considered distributed to you in the year inves- ted. Y ou may have to pay the 10% additional tax on early distributions, discussed later. Any amounts that were considered to be distributed when the investment in the collectible was made, and which were included in your income at that time, aren't in- cluded in your income when the collectible is actually dis- tributed from your IRA. Collectibles. These include: •Artworks, •Rugs, •Antiques, •Metals, •Gems, Publication 590-B (2024) Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs 23 --- Page 24 --- Page 24 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. •Stamps, •Coins, •Alcoholic beverages, and •Certain other tangible personal property. Exception. Y our IRA can invest in one, one -half, one- quarter, or one -tenth ounce U.S. gold coins, or one- ounce silver coins minted by the T reasury Depart- ment. It can also invest in certain platinum coins and cer- tain gold, silver, palladium, and platinum bullion. The coins must be in the possession of the custo- dian or trustee of the IRA. If the owner or the ben- eficiary of the IRA takes possession of the coins, the coins will be treated as distributed. Unrelated Business Income An IRA is subject to tax on unrelated business income if it carries on an unrelated trade or business. An unrelated trade or business means any trade or business regularly carried on by the IRA or by a partnership of which it is a member, and not substantially related to the IRA’s exempt purpose or function. If the IRA has $1,000 or more of unre- lated trade or business gross income, the IRA must file a Form 990 -T , Exempt Organization Business Income T ax Return. An IRA trustee is permitted to file Form 990 -T on behalf of the IRA. In the case of an IRA that operates on a calendar year, the Form 990 -T must be filed by April 15 following the close of the calendar year. In the case of an IRA that operates on a fiscal year, the Form 990-T must be filed by the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the fiscal year. See Pub. 598 for more information. Early Distributions Y ou must include early distributions of taxable amounts from your traditional IRA in your gross income. Early distri- butions are also subject to an additional 10% tax , as dis- cussed later. Early distributions defined. Early distributions are gen- erally amounts distributed from your traditional IRA ac- count or annuity before you are age 591/2, or amounts you receive when you cash in retirement bonds before you are age 591/2. If you were affected by a qualified disaster, see chapter 3 . Age 591/2 Rule Generally, if you are under age 591/2, you must pay a 10% additional tax on the distribution of any assets (money or other property) from your traditional IRA. Distributions be- fore you are age 591/2 are called “early distributions.” The 10% additional tax applies to the part of the distri- bution that you have to include in gross income. It is in ad- dition to any regular income tax on that amount. CAUTION! TIPA number of exceptions to this rule are discussed later under Exceptions . Also see Contributions Returned Be- fore Due Date of Return in chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A. After age 591/2 and before age 73. After you reach age 591/2, you can receive distributions without having to pay the 10% additional tax. Even though you can receive dis- tributions after you reach age 591/2, distributions aren't re- quired until you reach age 73. See When Must Y ou With- draw Assets? (Required Minimum Distributions) , earlier. Exceptions There are several exceptions to the age 591/2 rule. Even if you receive a distribution before you are age 591/2, you may not have to pay the 10% additional tax if you are in one of the following situations. •Y ou have unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than 7.5% of your AGI. •The distribution is for the cost of your medical insur- ance due to a period of unemployment. •Y ou are totally and permanently disabled. •Y ou have been certified as having a terminal illness. •Y ou are the beneficiary of a deceased IRA owner. •Y ou are receiving distributions in the form of a series of substantially equal periodic payments. •The distribution is for your qualified higher education expenses. •Y ou use the distributions to buy, build, or rebuild a first home. •The distribution is due to an IRS levy of the IRA or re- tirement plan. •The distribution is a qualified reservist distribution. •The distribution is a qualified birth or adoption distribu- tion. •The distribution is a qualified disaster distribution or qualified disaster recovery distribution. •The distribution is a corrective distribution. •The distribution is to a domestic abuse victim. •The distribution is for certain emergency personal ex- penses. Most of these exceptions are explained below. Note. Distributions that are timely and properly rolled over, as discussed in chapter 1 of Pub. 590 -A, aren't sub- ject to either regular income tax or the 10% additional tax. Certain withdrawals of excess contributions after the due date of your return are also tax free and therefore not sub- ject to the 10% additional tax. (See Excess Contributions Withdrawn After Due Date of Return in chapter 1 of Pub. 590- A.) This also applies to transfers incident to divorce, as discussed under Can Y ou Move Retirement Plan As- sets? in chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A. Receivership distributions. Early distributions (with or without your consent) from savings institutions placed 24 Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs Publication 590-B (2024) --- Page 25 --- Page 25 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. in receivership are subject to this tax unless one of the above exceptions applies. This is true even if the distribu- tion is from a receiver that is a state agency. Unreimbursed medical expenses. Even if you are un- der age 591/2, there are certain distribution amounts on which you don’t have to pay the 10% additional tax. If you have unreimbursed medical expenses (that would qualify for a medical deduction) in excess of 7. 5% of your (AGI) , defined next, you don’t have to pay the 10% additional tax on distributions from your IRA up to the amount by which those qualifying medical expenses ex- ceed 7.5% of your (AGI) . Y ou can only take into account unreimbursed medical expenses that you would be able to in- clude in figuring a deduction for medical expenses on Schedule A (Form 1040). Y ou don't have to itemize your deductions to take advantage of this exception to the 10% additional tax. Adjusted gross income (AGI). This is the amount on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 11. Medical insurance. Even if you are under age 591/2, you may not have to pay the 10% additional tax on distribu- tions during the year that aren't more than the amount you paid during the year for medical insurance for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents. Y ou won't have to pay the tax on these amounts if all of the following conditions apply. •Y ou lost your job. •Y ou received unemployment compensation paid un- der any federal or state law for 12 consecutive weeks because you lost your job. •Y ou receive the distributions during either the year you received the unemployment compensation or the fol- lowing year. •Y ou receive the distributions no later than 60 days af- ter you have been reemployed. Disabled. If you become disabled before you reach age 591/2, any distributions from your traditional IRA because of your disability aren't subject to the 10% additional tax. Y ou are considered disabled if you can furnish proof that you can't do any substantial gainful activity because of your physical or mental condition. A physician must de- termine that your condition can be expected to result in death or to be of long, continued, and indefinite duration. Beneficiary. If you die before reaching age 591/2, the as- sets in your traditional IRA can be distributed to your ben- eficiary or to your estate without either having to pay the 10% additional tax. However, if you inherit a traditional IRA from your de- ceased spouse and elect to treat it as your own (as dis- cussed under What if Y ou Inherit an IRA , earlier), any dis- tribution you later receive before you reach age 591/2 may be subject to the 10% additional tax. CAUTION!Distributions to terminally ill individuals. Y ou may be able to take a distribution from an IRA before reaching age 591/2 and not have to pay the 10% additional tax on early distributions if you receive the distribution on or after the date you have received a certification by a physician that you are terminally ill. Terminally ill. Y ou are considered terminally ill if you are certified by a physician as having an illness or physical condition which can reasonably be expected to result in death in 84 months or less after the date of the certifica- tion. Certification of terminal illness. A certification of termi- nal illness must include the following: •A statement that the individual’s illness or physical condition can be reasonably expected to result in death in 84 months or less after the date of certifica- tion. •A narrative description of the evidence that was used to support the statement of illness or physical condi- tion. •It must include the name and contact information of the physician making the statement. •The statement must include the date the physician ex- amined the individual or reviewed the evidence provi- ded by the individual, and the date that the physician signed the certification. •The statement must include the signature of the physi- cian making the statement, and an attestation from the physician that, by signing the form, the physician con- firms that the physician composed the narrative de- scription based on the physician’s examination of the individual or the physician’s review of the evidence provided by the individual. However, it is not sufficient evidence for an employee who is a physician to certify the physician’s own terminal illness. Certain corrective distributions not subject to 10% early distribution tax. Beginning with distributions made on December 29, 2022, and after, the 10% additional tax on early distributions will not apply to a corrective IRA dis- tribution, which consists of an excessive contribution (a contribution greater than the IRA contribution limit) and any earnings (the portion of the distribution subject to the 10% additional tax) allocable to the excessive contribu- tion, as long as the corrective distribution is made on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return. Substantially equal periodic payments. Y ou can re- ceive distributions from your traditional IRA before age 59½ if they are part of a series of substantially equal pay- ments over your life (or your life expectancy), or over the lives (or the joint life expectancies) of you and your benefi- ciary, without having to pay the 10% additional tax. The IRS has provided three general methods of com- puting the annual distribution amounts for meeting the re- quirements for a series of substantially equal periodic Publication 590-B (2024) Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs 25 --- Page 26 --- Page 26 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. payments: Notice 2022 -6 explains the three methods and identifies tables to be used for 2023 and after. (See Notice 2022-6 at IRS.gov/irb/2022-05_IRB#NOT -2022-06 ). The three methods are generally referred to as the re- quired minimum distribution method (RMD method), the fixed amortization method, and the fixed annuitization method. The latter two methods may require professional assistance. The RMD method, when used for this purpose, re- sults in the exact amount required to be distrib- uted each year, not the minimum amount. Distributions received as periodic payments on or after December 29, 2022, will not fail to be treated as substantially equal merely because they are re- ceived as an annuity. Note. For a series of substantially equal periodic pay- ments established in 2022, you may apply the guidance either in Notice 2022 -6 at IRS.gov/irb/ 2022-05_IRB#NOT -2022-06 , or in Revenue Ruling 2002- 62 which is on page 710 of Internal Revenue Bulletin 2002-42 at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf . Recapture tax for changes in distribution method under equal payment exception. Y ou may have to pay an early distribution recapture tax if you modify (for rea- sons other than your death or disability) the annual amount distributed to be different from the annual amount determined under the distribution method that you initially established under the substantially equal periodic pay- ment exception, and if the modification occurs before the date limitation explained in Modification date below. The recapture tax is imposed with respect to the calen- dar year in which the modification first occurs. The amount of tax is the amount of early distribution additional taxes that would have been imposed in prior years had the ex- ception not applied in those prior years, plus interest for the deferral periods. Modification date. The recapture tax applies if you modify the series of payments (other than because of death or disability) before the later of these two dates: 1.The 5th anniversary of the date of the first distribution of the series; or 2.The date you reach age 59½. However, the following two situations are not treated as a modification of the series for purposes of the recapture tax: (a) if your account is completely depleted of all as- sets; or (b) if you make a one -time change to the required minimum distribution method from one of the other meth- ods. In the event of a modification that triggers the recapture tax, the tax does not apply to any amounts distributed af- ter you reach age 59½. Report the recapture tax (including the interest on the deferral periods) on line 4 of Form 5329. Attach an explan- ation to the form. Don't write the explanation next to the line or enter any amount for the recapture on line 1 or 3 of the form. CAUTION! TIPOne- time switch. If you are receiving a series of sub- stantially equal periodic payments, you can make a one- time switch to the required minimum distribution method at any time without incurring the additional tax. Once a change is made, you must follow the required min- imum distribution method in all subsequent years. Transfers and rollovers of assets. Certain transfers and rollovers of assets from qualified plans or annuity con- tracts using the substantially equal periodic payment method are not considered a modification of the distribu- tion method if certain requirements are met. Transfers of assets of certain qualified plans. For this purpose, a qualified retirement plan is: •A qualified employee plan (including a qualified cash or deferred arrangement (CODA) under Internal Reve- nue Code section 401(k)), •A qualified employee annuity plan, or •A tax-sheltered annuity plan (403(b) plan). Transferor and transferee plans. A qualified plan distributing its assets using the substantially equal peri- odic payment method can roll over or transfer some or all its assets to another qualified plan. In this situation the plan transferring the assets is the transferor and the plan receiving the assets is the transferee. When a transfer or rollover of assets is not consid- ered a modification of the substantially equal pay- ment method. If a qualified plan is distributing its assets using the substantially equal periodic payment method transfers or rolls over some or all its assets to another qualified plan, the distributions from the transferee plan (or a combination of the transferee and transferor plan (if all its assets were not transferred)) is not considered a modi- fication of the substantially equal periodic payment method if the following requirements are met: •The transferor plan distributed or is distributing its as- sets using the substantially equal periodic payment method, •Distributions from the transferee and transferor plan (if applicable) would in combination continue to satisfy the requirements of the substantially equal periodic payment method, and •The distributions from a combination of the transferee and transferor plan (if applicable) continue to satisfy the requirements of the substantially equal periodic payment method as if they had been made only from the transferor plan. Higher education expenses. Even if you are under age 591/2, if you paid expenses for higher education during the year, part (or all) of any distribution may not be subject to the 10% additional tax. The part not subject to the tax is generally the amount that isn't more than the qualified higher education expenses (defined next) for the year for education furnished at an eligible educational institution (defined below). The education must be for you, your 26 Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs Publication 590-B (2024) --- Page 27 --- Page 27 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. spouse, or the children or grandchildren of you or your spouse. When determining the amount of the distribution that isn't subject to the 10% additional tax, include qualified higher education expenses paid with any of the following funds. •Payment for services, such as wages. •A loan. •A gift. •An inheritance given to either the student or the indi- vidual making the withdrawal. •A withdrawal from personal savings (including savings from a qualified tuition program). Don't include expenses paid with any of the following funds. •T ax-free distributions from a Coverdell education sav- ings account. •T ax-free part of scholarships and fellowships. •Pell grants. •Employer-provided educational assistance. •Veterans' educational assistance. •Any other tax-free payment (other than a gift or inheri- tance) received as educational assistance. Qualified higher education expenses. Qualified higher education expenses are tuition, fees, books, sup- plies, and equipment required for the enrollment or attend- ance of a student at an eligible educational institution. They also include expenses for special needs services in- curred by or for special needs students in connection with their enrollment or attendance. In addition, if the individual is at least a half -time student, room and board are quali- fied higher education expenses. Eligible educational institution. This is any college, university, vocational school, or other postsecondary edu- cational institution eligible to participate in the student aid programs administered by the U.S. Department of Educa- tion. It includes virtually all accredited, public, nonprofit, and proprietary (privately owned profit -making) postse- condary institutions. The educational institution should be able to tell you if it is an eligible educational institution. For more information, see chapter 9 of Pub. 970. First home. Even if you are under age 591/2, you don't have to pay the 10% additional tax on up to $10,000 of distributions you receive to buy, build, or rebuild a first home. T o qualify for treatment as a first -time homebuyer distribution, the distribution must meet all the following re- quirements. 1.It must be used to pay qualified acquisition costs (de- fined next) before the close of the 120th day after the day you received it. 2.It must be used to pay qualified acquisition costs for the main home of a first-time homebuyer (defined be- low) who is any of the following.a.Y ourself. b.Y our spouse. c.Y our or your spouse's child. d.Y our or your spouse's grandchild. e.Y our or your spouse's parent or other ancestor. 3.When added to all your prior qualified first-time home- buyer distributions, if any, total qualifying distributions can't be more than $10,000. If both you and your spouse are first -time home- buyers (defined later), each of you can receive distributions up to $10,000 for a first home without having to pay the 10% additional tax. Qualified acquisition costs. Qualified acquisition costs include the following items. •Costs of buying, building, or rebuilding a home. •Any usual or reasonable settlement, financing, or other closing costs. First- time homebuyer. Generally, you are a first -time homebuyer if you had no present interest in a main home during the 2 -year period ending on the date of acquisition of the home which the distribution is being used to buy, build, or rebuild. If you are married, your spouse must also meet this no-ownership requirement. Date of acquisition. The date of acquisition is the date that: •Y ou enter into a binding contract to buy the main home for which the distribution is being used, or •The building or rebuilding of the main home for which the distribution is being used begins. If you received a distribution to buy, build, or re- build a first home and the purchase or construc- tion was canceled or delayed, you could generally contribute the amount of the distribution to an IRA within 120 days of the distribution and not pay income tax or the 10% additional tax on early distributions. This contribution is treated as a rollover contribution to the IRA. Qualified reservist distributions. A qualified reservist distribution isn't subject to the additional tax on early distri- butions. Definition. A distribution you receive is a qualified re- servist distribution if the following requirements are met. •Y ou were ordered or called to active duty after Sep- tember 11, 2001. •Y ou were ordered or called to active duty for a period of more than 179 days or for an indefinite period be- cause you are a member of a reserve component. •The distribution is from an IRA or from amounts attrib- utable to elective deferrals under a section 401(k) or 403(b) plan or a similar arrangement. TIP TIP Publication 590-B (2024) Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs 27 --- Page 28 --- Page 28 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. •The distribution was made no earlier than the date of the order or call to active duty and no later than the close of the active duty period. Reserve component. The term “reserve component” means the: •Army National Guard of the United States, •Army Reserve, •Naval Reserve, •Marine Corps Reserve, •Air National Guard of the United States, •Air Force Reserve, •Coast Guard Reserve, or •Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service. Qualified birth or adoption distribution. A qualified birth or adoption distribution is any distribution from an ap- plicable eligible retirement plan if made during the 1 -year period beginning on the date on which your child was born or the date on which the legal adoption of your child was finalized. A qualified birth or adoption distribution must not ex- ceed $5,000 per taxpayer. In addition, an eligible adoptee is any individual (other than the child of the taxpayer’s spouse) who has not reached age 18 or is physically or mentally incapable of self-support. Amount may be repaid. If you receive a qualified birth or adoption distribution, you can make one or more contributions to an eligible retirement plan during the 3-year period beginning on the day after the date the dis- tribution was received. Y ou make this repayment if you are a beneficiary of that plan, the plan accepts rollover contri- butions, and the total of those contributions does not ex- ceed the amount of the qualified birth or adoption distribu- tion. Any contribution made to the eligible retirement plan as a repayment of a qualified birth or adoption distribution may be eligible for tax-free rollover treatment. In the case of a qualified birth or adoption distribution made on or before December 29, 2022, you can make one or more contributions after the distribution but before January 1, 2026. Distributions to victims of domestic abuse. An eligi- ble distribution to a domestic abuse victim is a distribution to a domestic abuse victim from an applicable eligible re- tirement plan and made to that individual during the 1 -year period beginning on any date on which the individual is a victim of domestic abuse by a spouse or domestic partner. See Notice 2024 -55, available at IRS.gov/irb/ 2024-28_IRB#NOT -2024-55 , for more information. Distribution limits. An eligible distribution to a do- mestic abuse victim must not exceed the lesser of $10,000 (indexed for inflation) or 50% of the present value of the IRA. Distributions for emergency personal expenses. An emergency personal expense distribution is a distribution from an applicable eligible retirement plan for the purpo-ses of meeting the unforeseeable or immediate financial needs relating to necessary personal or family emergency expenses. See Notice 2024 -55, available at IRS.gov/irb/ 2024-28_IRB#NOT -2024-55 , for more information. Distribution limits. Y ou are limited to taking one emergency personal expense distribution per calendar year and the amount that may be treated as an emer- gency personal expense distribution must not exceed the lesser of $1,000 or your total interest in the IRA. Y ou are also limited in taking emergency personal expense distri- butions in subsequent years as you may not take this type of distribution in the following 3 calendar years unless cer- tain requirements are met: •The previous distribution is repaid, or •The total of elective deferrals and employee contribu- tions to the plan (the total amounts contributed to the plan in the case of an individual retirement plan) made after the previous distribution is at least equal the amount of the distribution which has not been repaid. Repayment of certain early distributions. Contribu- tions made to the eligible retirement plan as a repayment of one of the early distributions listed below may be eligi- ble for tax-free rollover treatment: •Emergency personal expense distributions, •Domestic abuse distributions, and •T erminal illness distributions. Y ou can make one or more contributions to an eligible retirement plan during the 3 -year period beginning on the day after the date the distribution was received. Y ou must be a beneficiary of the plan and the total amount you repay can’t exceed the amount of the distribu- tion you receive regarding one of the early distributions in the list above. Additional 10% Tax The additional tax on early distributions is 10% of the amount of the early distribution that you must include in your gross income. This tax is in addition to any regular in- come tax resulting from including the distribution in in- come. The tax on early distributions doesn't apply to the part of a distribution that represents a return of your nondeduc- tible contributions (basis). Use Form 5329 to figure the tax. See the discussion of Form 5329, later, under Reporting Additional T axes for in- formation on filing the form. Example. T om Jones, who is 35 years old, receives a $3,000 distribution from his traditional IRA account. T om doesn't meet any of the exceptions to the 10% additional tax, so the $3,000 is an early distribution. T om never made any nondeductible contributions to his IRA. He must in- clude the $3,000 in his gross income for the year of the distribution and pay income tax on it. T om must also pay 28 Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs Publication 590-B (2024) --- Page 29 --- Page 29 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. an additional tax of $300 (10% (0.10) × $3,000). He files Form 5329. See the filled -in Form 5329 , later. Early distributions of funds from a SIMPLE retire- ment account made within 2 years of beginning participation in the SIMPLE are subject to a 25%, rather than a 10%, early distributions tax. Early Distribution Repayments Certain early distributions are excepted from the 10% ad- ditional tax and may be repaid to an eligible retirement plan, which includes an IRA. These distributions are known as “early distributions whose repayments are trea- ted as rollovers.” Early distributions whose repayments are treated as rollovers. This phrase describes the following distribu- tions: •Qualified birth or adoption distributions . •T erminal illness distributions . •Domestic abuse distributions . •Emergency personal expense distributions . •Qualified disaster recovery distributions . Repaying the distribution. When you make a repay- ment of certain early distributions affects how you report the distribution and repayment. Generally, if you make the distribution and a repayment in the same tax year, you can report the amount of the distribution, the amount of the re- payment of the distribution, and if the amount of the repay- ment is less than the amount of the distribution, figure and report the taxable portion of the distribution on Form 1040, line 5b. However, if you make a repayment in a year following the year you make the distribution, you will need to amend the return for the tax year during which you made the dis- tribution. Y ou will lower your income for that year by re- flecting the amount of the repayment. Amend your return by using Form 1040 -X, Amended U.S. Individual Income T ax Return. CAUTION!Figuring the taxable amount. When you make a repay- ment in a year other than the distribution year, you must figure the amount you must reduce your taxable income in the year of the distribution. If you are repaying less than the full distribution, you must figure the part of the distribu- tion that was taxable when distributed. This will be the amount you lower your income on your amended return. The tax -free/taxable ratio. The tax -free/taxable ratio is that fraction arrived at by dividing the retirement plans ba- sis by the value of the retirement plan at the end of the year. This ratio is used to determine what portion of the distribution you are repaying was taxable when distrib- uted. This will be the amount you reduce your income on your amended return. T ax-free/taxable ratio =Retirement Plan Basis Value of the Retirement Plan at the end of the year Amending Your Return When you repay an early distribution, you lower the in- come that was taxable in the year of the distribution. Y ou correct your taxable income for the year of the distribution by filing an amended return (Form 1040-X). Completing your amended return. Enter in column A, on line 1 of your Form 1040 -X, the amount of your AGI on your original return or the most recent amended return, if applicable. In column B, enter the amount you’re decreas- ing your income and the correct amount in Column C. In Part II, on page 2, describe the change you’re mak- ing, for example, “I am lowering my adjusted gross income to reflect the repayment of an early distribution from a re- tirement plan.” Describe any other changes you are mak- ing in addition to the repayment of the early distribution and adjust the amounts on line 1 accordingly.

MUST be removed before printing. Excess Accumulations (Insufficient Distributions) Y ou can't keep amounts in your traditional IRA (including SEP and SIMPLE IRAs) indefinitely. Generally, you must begin receiving distributions by April 1 of the year follow- ing the year in which you reach age 73. The required mini- mum distribution for any year after the year in which you reach age 73 must be made by December 31 of that later year. See Y our required beginning date for more informa- tion. Tax on excess. If distributions are less than the re- quired minimum distribution for the year, discussed earlier under When Must Y ou Withdraw Assets? (Required Mini- mum Distributions) , you may have to pay a 25% excise tax for that year on the amount not distributed as required. Additional tax rate for excess accumulations re- duced. Y ou may be subject to a reduced additional tax rate of 10% of the amount not distributed, if, during the correction window, you take a distribution of the amount on which the tax is due and submit a tax return reflecting this additional tax. The “correction window” ends on the earliest of the fol- lowing dates: •The date of mailing the deficiency notice with respect to the imposition of this tax, or •The date the tax is assessed, or •The last day of the second taxable year that begins af- ter the end of the taxable year in which the additional tax is imposed. Reporting the tax. Use Form 5329 to report the tax on excess accumulations. See the discussion of Form 5329, later, under Reporting Additional T axes for more informa- tion on filing the form. Request to waive the tax. If the excess accumulation is due to reasonable error, and you have taken, or are taking, steps to remedy the insufficient distribution, you can re- quest that the tax be waived. If you believe you qualify for this relief, attach a statement of explanation and complete Form 5329 as instructed under Waiver of tax for reasona- ble cause in the Instructions for Form 5329. Exemption from tax. If you are unable to take required distributions because you have a traditional IRA invested in a contract issued by an insurance company that is in state insurer delinquency proceedings, the 25% excise tax doesn't apply if the conditions and requirements of Reve- nue Procedure 92 -10 are satisfied. Those conditions and requirements are summarized below. Revenue Procedure 92-10 is in Cumulative Bulletin 1992 -1. Y ou can read the revenue procedure at most IRS offices, at many public li- braries, and online at IRS.gov . Conditions. T o qualify for exemption from the tax, the assets in your traditional IRA must include an affected in- vestment. Also, the amount of your required distribution must be determined as discussed earlier under When Must Y ou Withdraw Assets? (Required Minimum Distribu- tions) . Affected investment defined. Affected investment means an annuity contract or a guaranteed investment contract (with an insurance company) for which payments under the terms of the contract have been reduced or sus- pended because of state insurer delinquency proceedings against the contracting insurance company. Requirements. If your traditional IRA (or IRAs) in- cludes assets other than your affected investment, all tra- ditional IRA assets, including the available portion of your affected investment, must be used to satisfy as much as possible of your IRA distribution requirement. If the affec- ted investment is the only asset in your IRA, as much of the required distribution as possible must come from the available portion, if any, of your affected investment. Available portion. The available portion of your affec- ted investment is the amount of payments remaining after they have been reduced or suspended because of state insurer delinquency proceedings. Make up of shortfall in distribution. If the payments to you under the contract increase because all or part of the reduction or suspension is canceled, you must make up the amount of any shortfall in a prior distribution be- cause of the proceedings. Y ou make up (reduce or elimi- nate) the shortfall with the increased payments you re- ceive. Y ou must make up the shortfall by December 31 of the calendar year following the year that you receive in- creased payments. Reporting Additional Taxes Generally, you must use Form 5329 to report the tax on excess contributions, early distributions, and excess accu- mulations. Filing a tax return. If you must file an individual income tax return, complete Form 5329 and attach it to your Form 1040, 1040 -SR, or 1040 -NR. Enter the total additional taxes due on Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 8. Not filing a tax return. If you don't have to file a return, but do have to pay one of the additional taxes mentioned earlier, file the completed Form 5329 with the IRS at the time and place you would have filed Form 1040, 1040 -SR, or 1040 -NR. Be sure to include your address on page 1 and your signature and date on page 2. Enclose, but don't attach, a check or money order made payable to “United States T reasury” for the tax you owe, as shown on Form 5329. Write your social security number and “2024 Form 5329” on your check or money order. Form 5329 not required. Y ou don't have to use Form 5329 if any of the following situations exists. •Distribution code 1 (early distribution) is correctly shown in box 7 of Form 1099-R. If you don't owe any other additional tax on a distribution, multiply the taxa- ble part of the early distribution by 10% and enter the 30 Chapter 1 T raditional IRAs Publication 590-B (2024) --- Page 31 --- Page 31 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Designated Roth accounts are separate accounts under section 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b) plans that accept elective deferrals that are refer- red to as Roth contributions. These elective deferrals are included in your income, but qualified distributions from these accounts aren't included in your income. Designa- ted Roth accounts aren't IRAs and shouldn’t be confused with Roth IRAs. Contributions, up to their respective limits, can be made to Roth IRAs and designated Roth accounts according to your eligibility to participate. A contribution to one doesn't impact your eligibility to contribute to the other. See Pub. 575 for more information on designated Roth accounts. Introduction Regardless of your age, you may be able to establish and make nondeductible contributions to an individual retire- ment plan called a Roth IRA. Contributions not reported. Y ou don't report Roth IRA contributions on your return. What Is a Roth IRA? A Roth IRA is an individual retirement plan that, except as explained in this chapter, is subject to the rules that apply to a traditional IRA (defined next). It can be either an ac- count or an annuity. Individual retirement accounts and annuities are described in How Can a T raditional IRA Be Opened? in chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A. T o be a Roth IRA, the account or annuity must be des- ignated as a Roth IRA when it is opened. A deemed IRA can be a Roth IRA, a Roth SEP IRA or a Roth SIMPLE IRA. Unlike a traditional IRA, you can't deduct contributions to a Roth IRA. But, if you satisfy the requirements, quali- fied distributions (discussed later) are tax free and you can leave amounts in your Roth IRA as long as you live.Beginning in 2023, SEP and SIMPLE IRAs can be designated as Roth IRAs. Traditional IRA. A traditional IRA is any IRA that isn't a Roth IRA or SIMPLE IRA. T raditional IRAs are discussed in chapter 1 . Are Distributions Taxable? Y ou don't include in your gross income qualified distribu- tions or distributions that are a return of your regular con- tributions from your Roth IRA(s). Y ou also don't include distributions from your Roth IRA that you roll over tax free into another Roth IRA. Y ou may have to include part of other distributions in your income. See Ordering Rules for Distributions , later. Basis of distributed property. The basis of property distributed from a Roth IRA is its fair market value on the date of distribution, whether or not the distribution is a qualified distribution. Withdrawals of contributions by due date. If you with- draw contributions (including any net earnings on the con- tributions) by the due date of your return for the year in which you made the contribution, the contributions are treated as if you never made them. If you have an exten- sion of time to file your return, you can withdraw the contri- butions and earnings by the extended due date. The with- drawal of contributions is tax free, but you must include the earnings on the contributions in income for the year in which you made the contributions. What Are Qualified Distributions? A qualified distribution is any payment or distribution from your Roth IRA that meets the following requirements. 1.It is made after the 5-year period beginning with the first tax year for which a contribution was made to a Roth IRA set up for your benefit. 2.The payment or distribution is: a.Made on or after the date you reach age 591/2, b.Made because you are disabled (defined earlier), c.Made to a beneficiary or to your estate after your death, or d.One that meets the requirements listed under First home under Exceptions in chapter 1 (up to a $10,000 lifetime limit).

MUST be removed before printing. If you were affected by a qualified disaster, see chapter 3 . Additional Tax on Early Distributions If you receive a distribution that isn't a qualified distribu- tion, you may have to pay the 10% additional tax on early distributions as explained in the following paragraphs. Distributions of conversion and certain rollover con- tributions within 5 -year period. If, within the 5 -year pe- riod starting with the first day of your tax year in which you convert an amount from a traditional IRA or roll over an amount from a qualified retirement plan to a Roth IRA, you take a distribution from a Roth IRA, you may have to pay the 10% additional tax on early distributions. Y ou must generally pay the 10% additional tax on any amount attrib- utable to the part of the amount converted or rolled over (the conversion or rollover contribution) that you had to in- clude in income (recapture amount). A separate 5 -year period applies to each conversion and rollover. See Order- ing Rules for Distributions , later, to determine the recap- ture amount, if any. The 5 -year period used for determining whether the 10% early distribution tax applies to a distribution from a conversion or rollover contribution is separately deter- mined for each conversion and rollover, and isn't necessa- rily the same as the 5 -year period used for determining whether a distribution is a qualified distribution. See What Are Qualified Distributions , earlier. For example, if a calendar -year taxpayer makes a con- version contribution on February 25, 2024, and makes a regular contribution for 2023 on the same date, the 5 -year period for the conversion begins January 1, 2024, while the 5 -year period for the regular contribution begins on January 1, 2023. Unless one of the exceptions listed later applies, you must pay the additional tax on the portion of the distribu- tion attributable to the part of the conversion or rollover contribution that you had to include in income because of the conversion or rollover. Y ou must pay the 10% additional tax in the year of the distribution, even if you had included the conversion or rollover contribution in an earlier year. Y ou must also pay the additional tax on any portion of the distribution attribut- able to earnings on contributions. Other early distributions. Unless one of the exceptions listed below applies, you must pay the 10% additional tax on the taxable part of any distributions that aren't qualified distributions. Exceptions. Y ou may not have to pay the 10% additional tax in the following situations. •Y ou have reached age 591/2. •Y ou are totally and permanently disabled. •Y ou have been certified as having a terminal illness. •Y ou are the beneficiary of a deceased IRA owner. TIP•Y ou use the distribution to buy, build, or rebuild a first home. •The distributions are part of a series of substantially equal payments. •Y ou have unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than 7.5% of your AGI (defined earlier) for the year. •Y ou are paying medical insurance premiums during a period of unemployment. •The distribution is a corrective distribution. •The distributions are for your qualified higher educa- tion expenses. •The distribution is due to an IRS levy of the IRA or re- tirement plan. •The distribution is a qualified reservist distribution. •The distribution is a qualified birth or adoption distribu- tion. •The distribution is a qualified disaster distribution or qualified disaster recovery distribution. •The distribution is to a domestic abuse victim. •The distribution is for certain emergency personal ex- penses. Most of these exceptions are discussed earlier in chap- ter 1 under Early Distributions . If you were affected by a qualified disaster, see chapter 3 . Ordering Rules for Distributions If you receive a distribution from your Roth IRA that isn't a qualified distribution, part of it may be taxable. There is a set order in which contributions (including conversion con- tributions and rollover contributions from qualified retire- ment plans) and earnings are considered to be distributed from your Roth IRA. For these purposes, disregard the withdrawal of excess contributions and the earnings on them (discussed under What if Y ou Contribute T oo Much? in chapter 2 of Pub. 590 -A). Order the distributions as fol- lows. 1.Regular contributions. 2.Conversion and rollover contributions, on a first-in, first-out basis (generally, total conversions and roll- overs from the earliest year first). See Aggregation (grouping and adding) rules , later. T ake these conver- sion and rollover contributions into account as follows. a.T axable portion (the amount required to be inclu- ded in gross income because of the conversion or rollover) first. b.Nontaxable portion. 3.Earnings on contributions. Disregard rollover contributions from other Roth IRAs for this purpose. TIP Publication 590-B (2024) Chapter 2 Roth IRAs 35 --- Page 36 --- Page 36 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Aggregation (grouping and adding) rules. Deter- mine the taxable amounts distributed (withdrawn), distri- butions, and contributions by grouping and adding them together as follows. •Add together all distributions from all your Roth IRAs during the year. •Add together all regular contributions made for the year (including contributions made after the close of the year, but before the due date of your return). Add this total to the total undistributed regular contributions made in prior years. •Add together all conversion and rollover contributions made during the year. For purposes of the ordering rules, in the case of any conversion or rollover in which the conversion or rollover distribution is made in 2024 and the conversion or rollover contribution is made in 2025, treat the conversion or rollover contribution as contributed before any other conversion or rollover contributions made in 2025. Add any recharacterized contributions that end up in a Roth IRA to the appropriate contribution group for the year that the original contribution would have been taken into account if it had been made directly to the Roth IRA. Disregard any recharacterized contribution that ends up in an IRA other than a Roth IRA for the purpose of group- ing (aggregating) both contributions and distributions. Also, disregard any amount withdrawn to correct an ex- cess contribution (including the earnings withdrawn) for this purpose. Example. On October 15, 2020, Amelia converted all $80,000 in her traditional IRA to her Roth IRA. Her Forms 8606 from prior years show that $20,000 of the amount converted is her basis. Amelia included $60,000 ($80,000 − $20,000) in her gross income. On February 23, 2024, Amelia made a regular contribu- tion of $5,000 to a Roth IRA. On November 8, 2024, at age 60, Amelia took a $7,000 distribution from her Roth IRA. The first $5,000 of the distribution is a return of Amelia's regular contribution and isn't includible in her income. The next $2,000 of the distribution isn't includible in in- come because it was included previously. Figuring your recapture amount. If you had an early distribution from your Roth IRAs in 2024, you must allo- cate the early distribution by using the Recapture Amount —Allocation Chart located in Appendix C. Amount to include on Form 5329, line 1. Include on line 1 of your 2024 Form 5329 the following four amounts from the Recapture Amount —Allocation Chart that you fil- led out. •The amount you allocated to line 20 of your 2024 Form 8606. •The amount(s) allocated to your 2015 through 2024 Forms 8606, line 18. •The amount(s) allocated to your 2020 through 2024 Forms 1040, 1040-SR or 1040-NR, line 5b; 2019 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 4d; 2018 Form 1040, line 4b; your 2016 and 2017 Forms 1040, line 16b; Forms 1040A, line 12b; or 2015 through 2019 Forms 1040-NR, line 17b. •The amount from your 2024 Form 8606, line 25c. Also, include any amount you allocated to line 20 of your 2024 Form 8606 on your 2024 Form 5329, line 2, and enter exception number 09. Example. Ishmael, age 32, opened a Roth IRA in 2000. He made the following transactions into his Roth IRA. •In 2005, he converted $10,000 from his traditional IRA into his Roth IRA. He filled out a 2005 Form 8606 and attached it to his 2005 Form 1040.

He also entered zero on Form 1040, line 15a, and $10,000 on line 15b. •In 2016, he rolled over the balance of his qualified re- tirement plan, $20,000, into a Roth IRA when he changed jobs. He used a 2016 Form 1040 to file his taxes. He entered $20,000 on line 16a of Form 1040 because that was the amount reported in box 1 of his 2016 Form 1099-R. Box 5 of his 2016 Form 1099-R reported $0 because he didn't make any after-tax con- tributions to the qualified retirement plan. He entered $20,000 on line 16b of Form 1040 because that is the taxable amount that was rolled over in 2016. The total balance in his Roth IRA as of January 1, 2024, was $105,000 ($50,000 in contributions from 2000 through 2023 + $10,000 from the 2005 conversion + $20,000 from the 2016 rollover + $25,000 from earnings). He hasn't taken any early distribution from his Roth IRA before 2024. In 2024, he made a contribution of $5,500 to his Roth IRA. In August 2024 he took a $85,500 early distribution from his Roth IRA to use as a down payment on the pur- chase of his first home. See his filled out Illustrated Re- capture Amount Allocation Chart to see how he allocated the amounts from the above transactions. Based on his al- location, he would enter $20,000 on his 2024 Form 5329, line 1 (see Amount to include on Form 5329, line 1 , ear- lier). He should also report $10,000 on his 2024 Form 5329, line 2, and enter exception 09 because that amount isn't subject to the 10% additional tax on early distribu- tions.

Y ou aren't required to take distributions from your Roth IRA at any age. The minimum distribution rules that apply to traditional IRAs don't apply to Roth IRAs while the owner is alive. However, after the death of a Roth IRA owner, certain of the minimum distribution rules that apply to traditional IRAs also apply to Roth IRAs as explained later under Distributions After Owner's Death . Minimum distributions. Y ou can't use your Roth IRA to satisfy minimum distribution requirements for your tradi- tional IRA. Nor can you use distributions from traditional IRAs for required distributions from Roth IRAs. See Distri- butions to beneficiaries , later. Distributions After Owner's Death If a Roth IRA owner dies, the minimum distribution rules that apply to traditional IRAs apply to Roth IRAs as though the Roth IRA owner died before their required beginning date. See When Can Y ou Withdraw or Use Assets? in chapter 1. Distributions to beneficiaries. Generally, the entire in- terest in the Roth IRA must be distributed by the end of the 5th or 10th calendar year, as applicable, after the year of the owner's death unless the interest is payable to an eligible designated beneficiary over the life or life expect- ancy of the eligible designated beneficiary. See When Must Y ou Withdraw Assets? (Required Minimum Distribu- tions) in chapter 1. If paid as an annuity, the entire interest must be payable over a period not greater than the designated beneficiary's life expectancy and distributions must begin before the end of the calendar year following the year of death. Distri- butions from another Roth IRA can't be substituted for these distributions unless the other Roth IRA was inheri- ted from the same decedent. If the sole beneficiary is the spouse, they can either de- lay distributions until the decedent would have reached age 73 or treat the Roth IRA as their own. Combining with other Roth IRAs. A beneficiary can combine an inherited Roth IRA with another Roth IRA maintained by the beneficiary only if the beneficiary either: •Inherited the other Roth IRA from the same decedent, or •Was the spouse of the decedent and the sole benefi- ciary of the Roth IRA and elects to treat it as their own IRA. Distributions that aren't qualified distributions. If a distribution to a beneficiary isn't a qualified distribution, it is generally includible in the beneficiary's gross income in the same manner as it would have been included in the owner's income had it been distributed to the IRA owner when they were alive. If the owner of a Roth IRA dies before the end of: •The 5-year period beginning with the first tax year for which a contribution was made to a Roth IRA set up for the owner's benefit, or •The 5-year period starting with the year of a conver- sion contribution from a traditional IRA or a rollover from a qualified retirement plan to a Roth IRA. Each type of contribution is divided among multiple bene- ficiaries according to the pro -rata share of each. See Or- dering Rules for Distributions , earlier. Example. When Ms. Hibbard died in 2024, her Roth IRA contained regular contributions of $4,000, a conver- sion contribution of $10,000 that was made in 2020, and earnings of $2,000. No distributions had been made from her IRA. She had no basis in the conversion contribution in 2020. When she established this Roth IRA (her first) in 2020, she named each of her four children as equal beneficia- ries. Each child will receive one-fourth of each type of con- tribution and one- fourth of the earnings. An immediate dis- tribution of $4,000 to each child will be treated as $1,000 Publication 590-B (2024) Chapter 2 Roth IRAs 37 --- Page 38 --- Page 38 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. from regular contributions, $2,500 from conversion contri- butions, and $500 from earnings. In this case, because the distributions are made before the end of the applicable 5 -year period for a qualified dis- tribution, each beneficiary includes $500 in income for 2024. The 10% additional tax on early distributions doesn't apply because the distribution was made to the beneficiaries as a result of the death of the IRA owner. If distributions from an inherited Roth IRA are less than the required minimum distribution for the year, discussed in chapter 1 under When Must Y ou Withdraw Assets? (Required Minimum Distributions) , you may have to pay a 25% excise tax for that year on the amount not distributed as required. For the tax on excess accumulations (insufficient distributions), see Excess Ac- cumulations (Insufficient Distributions) under What Acts Result in Penalties or Additional T axes? in chapter 1. If this applies to you, substitute “Roth IRA” for “traditional IRA” in that discussion. 3. Disaster-Related Relief Introduction Special rules apply to tax -favored withdrawals, income in- clusion, and repayments for individuals who suffered eco- nomic losses as a result of certain major disasters. See Qualified Disaster Recovery Distributions , later, for more information. The principles set forth in Notice 2005 -92, 2005 -51 I.R.B. 1165, available at IRS.gov/IRB/2020-28_IRB (which provides guidance on the tax -favored treatment of distri- butions for victims of Hurricane Katrina), generally also apply to these rules. If you received a qualified disaster recovery distribution, it is taxable, but isn’t subject to the 10% additional tax on early distributions. (Use Form 8915 -F to figure the taxable portion of the distribution.) However, the distribution is in- cluded in income ratably over 3 years unless you elect to report the entire amount in the year of distribution. For ex- ample, if you received a $18,000 qualified disaster recov- ery distribution in 2021, you can include $6,000 in your in- come in 2021, 2022, and 2023. However, you can elect to include the entire distribution in your income in the year it was received. Also, you can repay the distribution and not be taxed on the distribution. See Repayment of Qualified Disaster Recovery Distributions , later. If you received a distribution from an eligible retirement plan to purchase or construct a main home but didn’t pur- chase or construct a main home because of a major dis- aster, you may be able to repay the distribution and not pay income tax or the 10% additional tax on early CAUTION!distributions. See Recontribution of Qualified Distributions for the Purchase or Construction of a Main Home , later. Use Forms 8915 -D and 8915 -F to report qualified dis- aster distributions and repayments. Also report repay- ments of qualified distributions for home purchases and construction that were canceled because of qualified dis- asters on 8915-D or 8915-F , as applicable. Qualified Disaster Recovery Distributions Qualified disaster recovery distributions. A qualified disaster recovery distribution is a qualified disaster distri- bution that meets certain criteria as described in the SE- CURE 2.0 Act of 2022. It is a distribution made from an eligible retirement plan to an individual whose main home was in a qualified disaster area during the period descri- bed in Qualified disaster recovery distribution , later. This individual must have sustained an economic loss because of the disaster. Main home (principal place of abode). Generally, your main home is the home where you live most of the time. A temporary absence due to special circumstances, such as illness, education, business, military service, evacuation, or vacation, won’t change your main home. Qualified disaster. A qualified disaster means any major disaster declared by the President under section 401 of the Robert T . Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency As- sistance Act after December 27, 2020. Qualified disaster area. A qualified disaster area means any area with respect to which the major disaster was declared under the Robert T . Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Incident period. The incident period for any qualified disaster is the period specified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as the period during which the disaster occurred. Qualified disaster recovery distribution. A qualified disaster recovery distribution is any distribution: •Made on or after the first day of the incident period of a qualified disaster and before the date that is 180 days after the applicable date with respect to such dis- aster; and •Made to an individual whose principal place of abode at any time during the incident period of such qualified disaster is located in the qualified disaster area; and •That individual has sustained an economic loss by reason of such qualified disaster. Applicable date. The term applicable date means the latest of: •December 29, 2022; •The first date of the incident period for the qualified disaster; or 38 Chapter 3 Disaster-Related Relief Publication 590-B (2024) --- Page 39 --- Page 39 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. •The declaration date of the qualified disaster. Distribution limit for qualified disaster recovery dis- tributions. The total of your qualified disaster recovery distributions from all plans is limited to $22,000 per disas- ter. If you take distributions from more than one type of plan, such as a 401(k) plan and an IRA, and the total amount of your distribution exceeds $22,000, you may al- locate the $22,000 limit among the plans by any reasona- ble method you choose. Example. In 2021, you received a distribution of $16,000. In 2022, you receive a distribution of $10,000 for the same disaster. Separately, each distribution meets the requirements for a qualified disaster recovery distribution. If you decide to treat the entire $16,000 received in 2021 as a qualified disaster distribution, only $6,000 of the 2022 distribution can be treated as a qualified disaster recovery distribution for the same disaster. Economic loss. Qualified disaster recovery distributions are permitted without regard to your need or the actual amount of your economic loss. Examples of an economic loss include, but aren’t limited to: 1.Loss, damage to, or destruction of real or personal property from fire, flooding, looting, vandalism, theft, wind, or other cause; 2.Loss related to displacement from your home; or 3.Loss of livelihood due to temporary or permanent lay- offs. Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan can be any of the following. •A qualified pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan (including a 401(k) plan). •The federal Thrift Savings Plan. •A qualified annuity plan. •A tax-sheltered annuity contract. •A governmental section 457 deferred compensation plan. •A traditional, SEP , SIMPLE, or Roth IRA (including Roth SEP and SIMPLE IRAs). Taxation of Qualified Disaster Recovery Distributions Qualified disaster recovery distributions are included in in- come in equal amounts over 3 years. However, if you elect, you can include the entire distribution in your in- come in the year it was received. Qualified disaster recovery distributions aren’t subject to the 10% additional tax (or the additional 25% tax for certain distributions from SIMPLE IRAs) on early distribu- tions from qualified retirement plans (including IRAs). Also, if you are receiving substantially equal periodic payments from a qualified retirement plan, the receipt of a qualified disaster recovery distribution from that plan won't be treated as a change in those substantially equal pay- ments merely because of that distribution. However, any distributions you received in excess of the $22,000 quali- fied disaster recovery distribution limit may be subject to the additional tax on early distributions. Repayment of Qualified Disaster Recovery Distributions If you choose, you can generally repay any portion of a qualified disaster recovery distribution that is eligible for tax-free rollover treatment to an eligible retirement plan. Also, you can repay a qualified disaster distribution made on account of a hardship from a retirement plan. However, see Exceptions , later, for qualified disaster distributions (or qualified disaster recovery distributions) you cannot re- pay. Y ou have 3 years from the day after the date you re- ceived the qualified disaster recovery distribution to make a repayment. The amount of your repayment can't be more than the amount of the original distribution. Amounts that are repaid are treated as trustee -to-trustee transfers and are not included in income. Also, for purposes of the one-rollover-per- year limitation for IRAs, a repayment to an IRA is not considered a rollover. For more information on how to report distributions and repayments, see the Instructions for Form 8915 -D (in the case of qualified 2019 disasters) or the Instructions for Form 8915 -F (in the case of qualified distributions re- ceived in 2020 and later years). Exceptions. Y ou cannot repay the following types of distributions. 1.Qualified disaster recovery distributions received as a beneficiary (other than as a surviving spouse). 2.Required minimum distributions. 3.Periodic payments (other than from an IRA) that are for: a.A period of 10 years or more, b.Y our life or life expectancy, or c.The joint lives or joint life expectancies of you and your beneficiary. Repayment of distributions if reporting under the 1-year election. If you elect to include all of your quali- fied disaster recovery distributions received in a year in in- come for that year and then repay any portion of the distri- bution during the allowable 3 -year period, the amount repaid will reduce the amount included in income for the year of distribution. If the repayment is made after the due date (including extensions) for your return for the year of distribution, you will need to file, with an amended return, a revised Form 8915 -D (if the repayment is for a qualified Publication 590-B (2024) Chapter 3 Disaster-Related Relief 39 --- Page 40 --- Page 40 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. 2019 disaster distribution) or a revised Form 8915 -F (in the case of qualified distributions received in 2020 and later years). See Amending Y our Return , later. Example. Maria received a $19,000 qualified disaster recovery distribution on February 15, 2024. After receiving a reimbursement from her insurance company for a casu- alty loss, Maria repays $19,000 of the qualified disaster re- covery distribution on September 10, 2024. She reports the distribution and repayment on Form 8915 -F , which she files with her timely filed 2024 tax return. As a result, no portion of the distribution is included in income on her re- turn. Repayment of distributions if reporting under the 3-year method. If you are reporting the distribution in in- come over the 3 -year period and you repay any portion of the distribution to an eligible retirement plan before filing your tax return, the repayment will reduce the portion of the distribution that is included in income for the year. If you repay a portion after the due date (including exten- sions) for filing your return, the repayment will reduce the portion of the distribution that is included in income on your next year’s return, unless you are eligible to amend your applicable prior year return or returns. (This would be a return for a year beginning the year of the distribution and included in the 3-year period.) If, during a year in the 3 -year period, you repay more than is otherwise includible in income for that year, the excess may be carried forward or back to reduce the amount included in income for the year. Example. John received an $18,000 qualified disaster recovery distribution on November 15, 2024. He doesn’t elect to include the entire distribution in his 2024 income but elects to include $6,000 on each of his 2024, 2025, and 2026 tax returns. On November 10, 2025, John re- pays $9,000. He makes no other repayments during the allowable 3 -year period. John may report the distribution and repayment in either of the following two ways. •Report $0 in income on his 2025 return and carry the $3,000 excess repayment ($9,000 – $6,000) forward to 2026 and reduce the amount reported in that year to $3,000. •Report $0 in income on his 2025 return, report $6,000 on his 2026 return, and file an amended return for 2024 to reduce the amount previously included in in- come to $3,000 ($6,000 – $3,000). Reporting repayments. See Form 8915 -D (for qualified 2019 disaster distributions) or Form 8915 -F (for qualified 2020 disaster distributions) if you received a qualified dis- tribution that you repaid, in whole or in part, before June 18, 2020 (June 25, 2021, for qualified 2020 distributions). Also, use Form 8915 -F for qualified disaster recovery dis- tributions that you receive as a result of qualified disasters occurring after January 25, 2021. TIPRecontribution of Qualified Disaster Recovery Distributions for the Purchase or Construction of a Main Home If you received a qualified disaster recovery distribution to purchase or construct a main home in certain major disas- ter areas, you can recontribute all or any part of that distri- bution to an eligible retirement plan . Applicable recontribution period. Y ou can make this recontribution (or recontributions) on or after the first day of the incident period of a qualified disaster under the SE- CURE 2.0 Act of 2020 and ending on the date that is 180 days after the applicable date for that disaster. Note. A qualified disaster under the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2020 is any major disaster declared by the President under section 401 of the Robert T . Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act after December 27, 2020. Qualified home purchase distribution. T o be a quali- fied distribution for the purpose of a home purchase or construction, the distribution must meet all of the following requirements. 1.The distribution is a hardship distribution from a 401(k) plan, a hardship distribution from a tax-shel- tered annuity plan (403(b) plan), or a qualified first-time homebuyer distribution from an IRA. 2.The distribution was received during the period begin- ning on the date which is 180 days before the first day of the incident period of the qualified disaster and ending on the date which is 30 days after the last day of such incident period. 3.The distribution was to be used to purchase or con- struct a main home in the disaster area and the home was not purchased or constructed because of the dis- aster. Any amount that is recontributed during the applicable recontribution period , is treated as a trustee -to-trustee transfer and is not included in income. Also, for purposes of the one -rollover-per- year limitation for IRAs, a recontri- bution to an IRA is not considered a rollover. A qualified disaster recovery distribution not recontrib- uted during the applicable recontribution period may be taxable for the year distributed and subject to the addi- tional 10% tax (or the additional 25% tax for certain SIM- PLE IRAs) on early distributions. See Form 8915 -D (for qualified 2019 disaster distribu- tions) or Form 8915 -F (for qualified 2020 disaster distribu- tions) if you received a qualified distribution that you re- contributed, in whole or in part, before the applicable 40 Chapter 3 Disaster-Related Relief Publication 590-B (2024) --- Page 41 --- Page 41 of 71 Fileid: … tion-590-b/2024/a/xml/cycle06/source 8:54 - 19-Mar-2025 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Additional Disaster Relief Issues Amending Your Return If, after filing your original return, you make a repayment, the repayment may reduce the amount of your qualified disaster distributions that were previously included in in- come. Depending on when a repayment is made, you may need to file an amended tax return to refigure your taxable income. If you make a repayment by the due date of your origi- nal return (including extensions), include the repayment on your amended return. If you make a repayment after the due date of your orig- inal return (including extensions), include it on your amen- ded return only if either of the following applies. •Y ou elected to include all of your qualified disaster re- covery distributions in income in the year of the distri- bution (not over 3 years) on your original return. •The amount of the repayment exceeds the portion of the qualified disaster recovery distributions that are in- cludible in income for 2024 and you choose to carry the excess back to your 2023 or 2022 tax return. Example. Y ou received a qualified disaster recovery distribution in the amount of $18,000 on October 16, 2022. Y ou choose to spread the $18,000 over 3 years ($6,000 in income for 2022, 2023, and 2024). On Novem- ber 19, 2024, you make a repayment of $9,000. For 2024, none of the qualified disaster distribution is includible in in- come. The excess repayment of $3,000 can be carried back to 2023 or 2022, as applicable. File Form 1040 -X to amend a return you have already filed. Generally, Form 1040 -X must be filed within 3 years after the date the original return was filed, or within 2 years after the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. Form 8915-F Replaces Form 8915-E Form 8915 -F replaces Form 8915 -E for reporting qualified 2020 disaster distributions and repayments of those distri- butions made in 2021, 2022, and 2023, as applicable. In previous years, distributions and repayments would be re- ported on the applicable Form 8915 for that year's disas- ters. For example, Form 8915 -D, Qualified 2019 Disaster Retirement Plan Distributions and Repayments, would be used to report qualified 2019 disaster distributions and re- payments. Form 8915- F is a forever form. Beginning in 2021, addi- tional alphabetical Forms 8915 will not be issued. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8915-F .Mandatory 60-Day Postponement Certain taxpayers affected by a federally declared disaster that is declared after December 20, 2019, may be eligible for a mandatory 60 -day postponement for certain tax deadlines such as filing or paying income, excise, and em- ployment taxes; and making contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The period beginning on the earliest incident date specified in the disaster declaration and ending on the date that is 60 days after either the earliest incident date or the date of the declaration, whichever is later, is the pe- riod during which the deadlines are postponed.

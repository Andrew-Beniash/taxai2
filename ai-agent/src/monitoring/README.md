# Data Quality Monitoring System

This directory contains the continuous monitoring system for ensuring data quality in the AI-Powered Tax Law Assistant. The system tracks tax law updates, evaluates AI response accuracy, and provides robust error handling.

## Components

### 1. monitor_data.py
Tracks tax law updates and detects outdated laws by:
- Periodically scanning IRS and tax court databases for updates
- Comparing against existing tax law data
- Flagging outdated or superseded tax laws
- Generating reports on data freshness

```bash
# Run once
python monitor_data.py --run-once

# Run continuously (daily checks)
python monitor_data.py --check-frequency=86400
```

### 2. audit_accuracy.py
Evaluates AI response accuracy against known tax law facts by:
- Running test queries against the AI system
- Comparing results with verified tax information
- Identifying potential inaccuracies or hallucinations
- Generating audit reports

```bash
# Run with default test set
python audit_accuracy.py

# Run with specific test set
python audit_accuracy.py --test-set=advanced

# Run with random sampling
python audit_accuracy.py --random-sample --sample-size=20
```

### 3. error_handler.py
Provides centralized error logging and alerting by:
- Categorizing errors by severity and type
- Maintaining detailed error logs with context
- Sending alerts for critical errors
- Generating error trend reports

```bash
# Generate error reports
python error_handler.py report --days=7 --trends --frequent

# Clean up old error logs
python error_handler.py cleanup
```

## Integration

These tools work together to maintain high data quality:

1. `monitor_data.py` ensures the knowledge base contains fresh, up-to-date tax information
2. `audit_accuracy.py` verifies that the AI system correctly uses this information
3. `error_handler.py` captures and alerts on any issues in the retrieval or processing pipeline

## Configuration

Each tool has its own configuration options that can be customized:

- Default configs are embedded in each script
- Custom configs can be provided via JSON files
- DB paths, alert thresholds, and monitoring frequencies are all configurable

## Alert Mechanisms

The system provides alerts via:
- Structured logs
- Database records for analysis
- Configurable email notifications (placeholder implementation)

## Usage in Development

During development, these tools can be used to:
1. Monitor the freshness of tax law data
2. Validate AI responses against expected answers
3. Track and debug system errors

## Future Extensions

- Integration with cloud monitoring services
- Dashboard for visualizing data quality metrics
- Advanced anomaly detection for error patterns
